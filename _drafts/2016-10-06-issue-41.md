Welcome to issue 41! Swift 4.0 development continues, and it looks like [Swift 3.0.1 Preview-2](https://github.com/apple/swift/releases/tag/swift-3.0.1-PREVIEW-2) has landed.

<!--excerpt-->

### Commits and pull requests

Jordan Rose [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5141) a bug that prevented `@NSManaged` properties from satisfying protocol requirements.

As mentioned in [Issue 39](/issue-39/), Airspeed Velocity numbered and categorized each of the FIXMEs associated with ABI stability. This week, Doug Gregor [knocked out](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5132) 3 of the standard library's FIXME's (#35, #37, #39) by removing the `_AnyHashableProtocol` hack from initial implementation of [SE-0131](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0131-anyhashable.md).

Enrico Granata [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5133) changes to allow demangling of methods in extensions.

Alex Blewitt [added supported](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/667) for `ISO8601` calendars in swift-corelibs-foundation.

### Accepted proposals

Proposal [SE-0141](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0141-available-by-swift-version.md): *Availability by Swift version* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-October/000289.html).

> Feedback on the proposal was light but entirely positive. The proposal is accepted.

Proposal [SE-0142](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0142-associated-types-constraints.md): *Permit where clauses to constrain associated types* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-October/000290.html).

> Feedback on this proposal was overwhelmingly positive. The proposal is accepted.

### Mailing lists

Ben Asher [asked for advice](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20161003/003099.html) on debugging slow compile times and shared some stats on his project. Mark Lacey [replied](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20161003/003103.html) with [a few tips](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20161003/003110.html).

> Since upgrading to Swift 3, the number of trouble function bodies has gone from > 150 to < 20, so we're really happy about that! The only issue though is that build time overall increased by ~1 min (amount of time to build all targets before automatically merging to master in our integration build).

Erica Sadun [noted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161003/027566.html) some unintended consequences from implementing [SE-0111](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0111-remove-arg-label-type-significance.md).

> SE-0111 established that Swift's type system would not allow function argument labels to be expressed as part of a function type. As I've been working with curried functions, I'm discovering an unintended consequence of this proposal in that it strips curried functions of their external labels and the resulting calls of their readability.

### Finally

[Is Apple using Swift in iOS](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/is-apple-using-swift-4a6c80f74599#.upb3embbg), yet? It looks like the iOS 10 Music app is [mostly Swift](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/783669525594210309)! ðŸ˜Ž But it looks like not much else, unfortunately.
