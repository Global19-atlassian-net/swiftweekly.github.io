### Proposals in review

[SE-0239](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0239-codable-range.md): *Add Codable conformance to Range types* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0239-add-codable-conformance-to-range-types/18794).

> [SE-0167](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md) introduced `Codable` conformance for some types in the standard
library, but not the `Range` family of types. This proposal adds that
conformance.
>
> `Range` is a very useful type to have conform to `Codable`. A good usage example is a range being sent to/from a client/server to convey a range of time using `Date`, or a safe operating temperature range using `Measurement<UnitTemperature>`.

### Swift Forums

[Ravi Kandhadai Madhavan](https://twitter.com/rkandhad) wrote [about](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-os-log-using-custom-string-interpolation-and-compile-time-interpretation/18799) improving Swift APIs for Apple's [unified logging systems](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/721/).

> We propose to change the Swift APIs for the Apple's unified logging system (namely, `os_log` and `os_signpost`)
to accept string interpolations instead of the printf-style format string and varargs combination that they currently accept.
This means Swift users can pass in string interpolations to the logging functions e.g. like `osLog("Fatal Error \(errno)")`.

### Finally

It's not only programming languages that are hard... [or is it](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1075156018198265856)?
