### News and community

[Keith Smiley](https://twitter.com/SmileyKeith/) shared [an overview](https://gist.github.com/keith/3f01e1c9b763e9aceb70411927a0c42c) of Xcode build settings to compiler flags for Swift memory exclusivity.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/) shared [an interesting easter egg](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/1098628355539124224): the [magic number](https://t.co/VE0jlyjZWA) for `swiftmodule` files is `E2 9C A8 0E`, or `✨14`, referring to the initial name for Swift and its (planned) release year.
