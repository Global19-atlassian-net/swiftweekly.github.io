### News and community

The LLVM Foundation [announced the program for the 2018 LLVM Developers' Meeting](http://blog.llvm.org/2018/08/announcing-program-for-2018-llvm.html) scheduled for October 17–18 in San Jose. Swift nerds will [recognize](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/talk-abstracts.html#talk15) several [names](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/talk-abstracts.html#talk13) on the [program](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/talk-abstracts.html#talk12).

The [Swift Server Work Group](https://swift.org/server/) has a new stated goal:

> The main goal of the Swift Server work group is to eventually recommend libraries and tools for server application development with Swift.

[SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) is currently the sole recommended library, but you can stay on top of updates from the group in the [Server category of the Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/development/server).


### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://github.com/DougGregor) merged in some new ["Request-Evaluator" infrastructure](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/1032774695039324160) around the type checker to help eliminate mutable state and track dependencies. See the [design document](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/RequestEvaluator.md) and [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18923) for all the details.

[Erik Eckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) removed the now unneeded [pinning built-ins and SIL instructions](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18922). As [summarized in a tweet](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1032871154032111616): "Nice simplification of the Swift reference counting model - the entire concept of “pinning” is gone now, thanks to exclusivity enforcement".


### Accepted proposals

[SE-0200](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0200-raw-string-escaping.md): _Enhancing String Literals Delimiters to Support Raw Text_ was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0200-enhancing-string-literals-delimiters-to-support-raw-text/15822/1).

[SE-0226](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0226-package-manager-target-based-dep-resolution.md): _Package Manager Target Based Dependency Resolution_
was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0226-package-manager-target-based-dependency-resolution/15404/16) with generally positive comments all around.

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0132](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0132-sequence-end-ops.md): _Rationalizing Sequence end-operation names_ [was rejected](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/898). Although it would make sequence and collection operation naming more consistent (e.g. "first" vs "start" vs "prefix"), the core team decided the source compatibility hit would be too great.

[SE-0222](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0222-lazy-compactmap-sequence.md): _Lazy CompactMap Sequence_ [was rejected](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0222-lazy-compactmap-sequence/14850/16). The proposal would have added a new `LazyCompactMapCollection` to represent a `compactMap` to more efficiently handle a chain of `map` and `filter` operations.

The core team decided the performance benefits were negligible and not worth the increased complexity pointed out during the review discussion.
