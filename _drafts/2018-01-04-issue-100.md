**Welcome to issue #100!** ðŸŽ‰As you've probably heard by now, this will be [**the final issue**](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/swift-weekly-brief-hiatus/) of the newsletter. I encourage you to read [my entire blog post](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/swift-weekly-brief-hiatus/) announcement, but here's the TL;DR: *it's time for me to focus on other projects and priorities, and if possible, transition the newsletter to a new owner.* Luckily, the project is extremely healthy and could easily be taken over by an eager and motivated member of the community. If you are interested, please get in touch!

This newsletter started out as an accident. It [began on my personal blog](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/swift-open-source/) before I decided to [create this site](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/new-weekly-brief/) and start the mailing list. Two years later, here we are. It's been a pleasure to deliver an issue to your inbox each week. The good news is that I'll still be bringing you Swift news regularly &mdash; in [podcast form](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped) with the one and only [JP Simard](https://twitter.com/simjp). If you haven't subscribed, [you should do it now](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/swift-unwrapped/id1209817203). ðŸ˜„ I'll also continue to write about Swift on my blog. Of course, there are many other fantastic blogs to follow in the Swift community, which I've linked to often &mdash; so there will be no shortage of content for sure! My hope is that the new [Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/discourse-rollout-re-schedule/7258), which should be rolled out soon, will help make following Swift evolution and other Swift.org news easier without this newsletter.

Alright &mdash; let's get on with our last issue!

### News and community

Daniel Duan [made a YouTube video](https://duan.ca/2017/12/23/contributing-to-open-source-foundation/) tutorial on how to contribute to open source Swift. In the video he discovers, reports, fixes, and merges a bug in corelibs-foundation. ðŸ¤“ ðŸ“º

### Finally

And finally &mdash; thank you for reading. I cannot say 'thank you' enough. Thanks for reading these issues over the past two years. Thanks to all of the fantastic sponsors that helped motivate and incentivize me to keep writing. And thanks to [the other great writers](https://swiftweekly.github.io/authors/) who wrote issues so that I could take much-needed breaks: [Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache), [JP Simard](https://twitter.com/simjp), [Bas Broek](https://twitter.com/BasThomas), [Greg Heo](https://twitter.com/gregheo), [Ben Asher](https://twitter.com/benasher44), [Garric Nahapetian](https://twitter.com/garricn), and [Roman Volkov](https://twitter.com/volkovre).

This is the final "finally", but who knows. Maybe I'll resurrect this project in the future. Until then. <br/>&mdash;jsq
