### Commits and pull requests

> TODO

Shortly after it was featured in last week's brief, Erik Eckstein [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4927) a [bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1901) that forced internal Foundation and XCTest symbols to be marked as `public`. Thanks to this, Brian Gesiak was able to [send](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/174) a pull request to correctly specify internal API in XCTest.

Brian Gesiak [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4972) a pull request that allows macOS host machines to compile the Swift runtime for Android. Previously only Linux machines could compile for Android.

Work continues to improve compiler diagnostics. Harlan Haskins [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4980) a pull request to prevent a compiler assertion when incorrectly using `var` for type-inferred parameters in closures, such as `takesClosure { (var d) in d }`. With Harlan's change, this now produces the error "parameters may not have the 'var' specifier". Mark Lacey [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4998) a pull request to fix this confusing error message:

{% highlight swift %}
func foo(x: Int, _ y: Int) -> Int {
  return x + y
}

func bar() -> Int {
  return foo(3, 5) // error: unnamed argument #2 must precede unnamed argument #1
}
{% endhighlight %}

Mark's work corrects the error message:

{% highlight swift %}
func bar() -> Int {
  return foo(3, 5) // error: missing argument label 'x' in call
}
{% endhighlight %}

Eli Perkins [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4929) a pull request to mark `UnicodeScalar.utf16` and `UnicodeScalar.UTF16View` as `public`, completing one of the starter tasks introduced in last week's brief.

@damuellen [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4928) a badge to the Swift README that displays the build status of Swift on Ubuntu 16.04. Swift now runs on Ubuntu 14, 15, and 16.
