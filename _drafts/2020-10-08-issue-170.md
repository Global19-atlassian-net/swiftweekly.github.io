[My last issue](https://basthomas.github.io/goodbye-swift-weekly). I have had
such a great time writing this newsletter with the help of some great friends,
and I can't thank all of you enough.

I'm very excited for the future of the newsletter now that Kristaps is taking
it over, with me watching from the sidelines.

All the best,
Bas
