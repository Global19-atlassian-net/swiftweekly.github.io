### Community

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) wrote two excellent (unofficial) blog posts this week on the Swift compiler type system. These are the first of what will be a four-part series, so stay tuned. Each post is extremely well-written and incredibly thorough. If you have any interest in the Swift compiler, you should read these. Oh, and be sure to say thanks to [Slava](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov)! 🙌

Jordan Rose [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3404) changes for [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scope Access Level* (`private` and `fileprivate`) that allow public members inside internal types.

Doug Gregor [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3459) proposal [SE-0112](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md): *Improved `NSError` Bridging*.

Joe Groff [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3475) prelimenary SILGen and runtime support for importing Objective-C `id` as Swift `Any`.

Jordan Rose [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/445) corelibs-foundation for proposal [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scope Access Level* (`private` and `fileprivate`).

### Accepted proposals

Matthew Johnson's proposal, [SE-0115](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0115-literal-syntax-protocols.md): *Rename Literal Syntax Protocols*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000220.html).

> The community and core team agree that this proposal is a better set of names for these protocols.  The core team agrees with the community sentiment that “By” is better than “As” in the protocol names, and has accepted the proposal with this revision.
>
> Thank you to Matthew Johnson and many others for driving this discussion forward!

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0114](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0114-buffer-naming.md): *Updating Buffer "Value" Names to "Header" Names*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000221.html).

> The community discussion and core team unanimously agree that this is the right thing to do.

> Thank you to Erica Sadun for driving this discussion forward!

The second version of Anton Zhilin's proposal, [SE-0077](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md): *Improved operator declarations*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000219.html) with minor revisions.

> This round of feedback focused on naming, both of the attributes for precedence groups and the conventions to use for naming the groups themselves:
>
> - The community expressed a strong preference for 'higherThan' and 'lowerThan' precedence relationships over the previously-proposed 'strongerThan' and 'weakerThan', and the core team *agrees* that these are better terms of art. The proposal is accepted with these terms revised.
>
> - The standard library team reviewed the proposed names for the standard precedence groups, and suggests the following minor naming revisions:
>
>    - AssignmentPrecedence
>    - TernaryPrecedence
>    - DefaultPrecedence
>    - LogicalDisjunctionPrecedence
>    - LogicalConjunctionPrecedence
>    - ComparisonPrecedence
>    - NilCoalescingPrecedence
>    - CastingPrecedence
>    - RangeFormationPrecedence
>    - AdditionPrecedence
>    - MultiplicationPrecedence
>    - BitwiseShiftPrecedence
>
> establishing a convention of \<Noun\>Precedence for precedence group names. The core team accepts the proposal with these revised standard precedence names.
>
> Thanks Anton for shepherding this proposal through the review process!

Doug Gregor's and Charles Srstka's proposal, [SE-0112](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md): *Improved `NSError` Bridging*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000222.html).

> The community and core team agree that this proposal is a huge step forward that enriches the experience working with and extending the Cocoa `NSError` model in Swift.  The core team requests one minor renaming of "attemptRecovery(optionIndex:andThen:)" to "attemptRecovery(optionIndex:resultHandler:)".  It also discussed renaming `CustomNSError` and `RecoverableError`, but decided to stay with those names.

> Thank you to Doug Gregor and Charles Srstka for driving this discussion forward, and for Doug Gregor taking the charge on the implementation effort to make this happen for Swift 3!

Anton Zhilin's and Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0109](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0109-remove-boolean.md): *Remove the `Boolean` protocol*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000228.html).

> The community and core team are overall positive on the removal of the Boolean protocol, under the rationale that it is not pulling its weight and its name is confusing next to Bool.  Several members of the core team and a member of the community points out that the *functionality* provided by the Boolean protocol could make sense for Swift if a well-considered design was available, but the core team feels that we should remove Boolean for Swift 3, and consider adding back a replacement when and if a compelling use-case presents itself to motivate that work.

Tony Parker's and Philippe Hausler's proposal, [SE-0086](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0086-drop-foundation-ns.md): *Drop NS Prefix in Swift Foundation*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000229.html).

> This proposal has evolved greatly from a single bullet item in the original proposal for improving the translation of Objective-C APIs ([SE-0005](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0005-objective-c-name-translation.md): Better Translation of Objective-C APIs Into Swift). Discussion spawned the transformative work on Foundation value types ([SE-0069](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0069-swift-mutability-for-foundation.md): Mutability and Foundation Value Types), and other improvements to the mapping of Objective-C APIs into Swift (e.g., [SE-0033](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0033-import-objc-constants.md): Import Objective-C Constants as Swift Types, [SE-0044](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0044-import-as-member.md): Import as Member, [SE-0112](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md): Improved NSError Bridging) have informed and improved this proposal.

Proposal [SE-0118](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0118-closure-parameter-names-and-labels.md): *Closure Parameter Names and Labels* from Dave Abrahams, Dmitri Gribenko, and Maxim Moiseev was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000230.html).

> The proposal has been very well received by the community and core team.  The core team agrees with community contributions that `ManagedBuffer<Header,Element>.create(minimumCapacity: 10, makingValueWith: makeHeader)` should be renamed to `makingHeaderWith:`.  The core team extensively discussed the name of `lines.split(whereSeparator: isAllWhitespace)` and agreed to keep the name as proposed, because the alternative name `lines.split(where: isAllWhitespace)` could be confusing given the behavior of dropping the "separator" from the result.
>
> Thank you to Dave Abrahams, Dmitri Gribenko, and Maxim Moiseev for driving this discussion forward! I filed [SR-2072](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2072) to track implementation of this feature.

Andrew Trick's proposal, [SE-0107](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0107-unsaferawpointer.md): *UnsafeRawPointer API*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000231.html).

> The community and core team agree that this proposal clarifies the rules around the unsafe pointer APIs, while making them "work by default" and balance safety and unsafety in an understandable way.  Andy has revised the proposal several times due to community feedback (which is why we extended the review period), which makes my job easier because the core team agrees to accept it nearly as-is :-).  The only request from the core team is to remove the default value from the "alignedTo:" parameters of the allocate and deallocate methods, forcing their callers to be explicit about the alignment required by an allocation.
>
> Thank you to Andrew Trick for driving this discussion as well as the implementation forward!

Tony Allevato's and Doug Gregor's proposal, [SE-0091](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0091-improving-operators-in-protocols.md): *Improving operator requirements in protocols*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000232.html).

> The second iteration of this proposal has been very well received by both the community and core team.  The core team requests one minor modification: in an effort to reduce the scope of the proposal, it should specifically require that operator declarations in classes be written as static (or equivalently, as "final class").  In the future, support for operators may be extended to support dynamic dispatch, and the core team wants to keep the design space open.  The core team also observed that the impact on the standard library is not captured in this proposal, but that can be incorporated later (as an amendment to this proposal) since it should have little user impact.
