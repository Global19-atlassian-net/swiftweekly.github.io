Welcome to issue #30! Swift [preview 3.0](https://github.com/apple/swift/milestone/4?closed=1) is underway, and the Core Team is still pushing through tons of Swift evolution proposals.

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-2025](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2025): [SwiftPM] "swift build" usage text should specify defaults
- [SR-2022](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2022): [Compiler] Improve the fixit for type checking in switch statements
- [SR-1894](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1894): [Compiler] Return type of `NSCoding.Protocol` is considered ObjC-compatible, but crashes

### Commits and pull requests

Jordan Rose [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3404) changes for [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scope Access Level* (`private` and `fileprivate`) that allow public members inside internal types.

Doug Gregor [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3459) proposal [SE-0112](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md): *Improved `NSError` Bridging*.

Joe Groff [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3475) prelimenary SILGen and runtime support for importing Objective-C `id` as Swift `Any`.

Jordan Rose [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/445) corelibs-foundation for proposal [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scope Access Level* (`private` and `fileprivate`).

### Accepted proposals

Matthew Johnson's proposal, [SE-0115](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0115-literal-syntax-protocols.md): *Rename Literal Syntax Protocols*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000220.html).

> The community and core team agree that this proposal is a better set of names for these protocols.  The core team agrees with the community sentiment that “By” is better than “As” in the protocol names, and has accepted the proposal with this revision.
>
> Thank you to Matthew Johnson and many others for driving this discussion forward!

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0114](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0114-buffer-naming.md): *Updating Buffer "Value" Names to "Header" Names*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000221.html).

> The community discussion and core team unanimously agree that this is the right thing to do.

> Thank you to Erica Sadun for driving this discussion forward!

The second version of Anton Zhilin's proposal, [SE-0077](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md): *Improved operator declarations*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000219.html) with minor revisions.

> This round of feedback focused on naming, both of the attributes for precedence groups and the conventions to use for naming the groups themselves:
>
> - The community expressed a strong preference for 'higherThan' and 'lowerThan' precedence relationships over the previously-proposed 'strongerThan' and 'weakerThan', and the core team *agrees* that these are better terms of art. The proposal is accepted with these terms revised.
>
> - The standard library team reviewed the proposed names for the standard precedence groups, and suggests the following minor naming revisions:
>
>    - AssignmentPrecedence
>    - TernaryPrecedence
>    - DefaultPrecedence
>    - LogicalDisjunctionPrecedence
>    - LogicalConjunctionPrecedence
>    - ComparisonPrecedence
>    - NilCoalescingPrecedence
>    - CastingPrecedence
>    - RangeFormationPrecedence
>    - AdditionPrecedence
>    - MultiplicationPrecedence
>    - BitwiseShiftPrecedence
>
> establishing a convention of \<Noun\>Precedence for precedence group names. The core team accepts the proposal with these revised standard precedence names.
>
> Thanks Anton for shepherding this proposal through the review process!

Doug Gregor's and Charles Srstka's proposal, [SE-0112](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md): *Improved `NSError` Bridging*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000222.html).

> The community and core team agree that this proposal is a huge step forward that enriches the experience working with and extending the Cocoa `NSError` model in Swift.  The core team requests one minor renaming of "attemptRecovery(optionIndex:andThen:)" to "attemptRecovery(optionIndex:resultHandler:)".  It also discussed renaming `CustomNSError` and `RecoverableError`, but decided to stay with those names.

> Thank you to Doug Gregor and Charles Srstka for driving this discussion forward, and for Doug Gregor taking the charge on the implementation effort to make this happen for Swift 3!

Anton Zhilin's and Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0109](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0109-remove-boolean.md): *Remove the `Boolean` protocol*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000228.html).

> The community and core team are overall positive on the removal of the Boolean protocol, under the rationale that it is not pulling its weight and its name is confusing next to Bool.  Several members of the core team and a member of the community points out that the *functionality* provided by the Boolean protocol could make sense for Swift if a well-considered design was available, but the core team feels that we should remove Boolean for Swift 3, and consider adding back a replacement when and if a compelling use-case presents itself to motivate that work.
