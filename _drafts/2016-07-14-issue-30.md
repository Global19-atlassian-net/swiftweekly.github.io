### Accepted proposals

Matthew Johnson's proposal, [SE-0115](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0115-literal-syntax-protocols.md): *Rename Literal Syntax Protocols*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000220.html).

> The community and core team agree that this proposal is a better set of names for these protocols.  The core team agrees with the community sentiment that “By” is better than “As” in the protocol names, and has accepted the proposal with this revision.

> Thank you to Matthew Johnson and many others for driving this discussion forward!

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0114](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0114-buffer-naming.md): *Updating Buffer "Value" Names to "Header" Names*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000221.html).

> The community discussion and core team unanimously agree that this is the right thing to do.

The second version of Anton Zhilin's proposal, [SE-0077](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md): *Improved operator declarations*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000219.html) with minor revisions.

> This round of feedback focused on naming, both of the attributes for precedence groups and the conventions to use for naming the groups themselves:
>
> - The community expressed a strong preference for 'higherThan' and 'lowerThan' precedence relationships over the previously-proposed 'strongerThan' and 'weakerThan', and the core team *agrees* that these are better terms of art. The proposal is accepted with these terms revised.
>
> - The standard library team reviewed the proposed names for the standard precedence groups, and suggests the following minor naming revisions:
>
>    - AssignmentPrecedence
>    - TernaryPrecedence
>    - DefaultPrecedence
>    - LogicalDisjunctionPrecedence
>    - LogicalConjunctionPrecedence
>    - ComparisonPrecedence
>    - NilCoalescingPrecedence
>    - CastingPrecedence
>    - RangeFormationPrecedence
>    - AdditionPrecedence
>    - MultiplicationPrecedence
>    - BitwiseShiftPrecedence
>
> establishing a convention of \<Noun\>Precedence for precedence group names. The core team accepts the proposal with these revised standard precedence names.
>
> Thanks Anton for shepherding this proposal through the review process!
