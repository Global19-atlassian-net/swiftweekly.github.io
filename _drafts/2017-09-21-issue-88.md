### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 29](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/86442) we discuss some recent Swift Evolution proposals, Xcode 9 GM, along with a boatload of follow-ups from Ted Kremenek and Pierre Habouzit.

### News and community

Ted Kremenek published [the official Swift 4.0 announcement](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-0-released/) on the Swift.org blog. Congrats to [Ole Begemann](https://oleb.net) for getting a shout out in the opening paragraphs!

> Swift 4 is now officially released! Swift 4 builds on the strengths of Swift 3, delivering greater robustness and stability, providing source code compatibility with Swift 3, making improvements to the standard library, and adding features like archival and serialization.
>
> You can watch a quick overview of it by watching the [WWDC 2017: Whatâ€™s New in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/402/) presentation, and try out some of the new features in this [playground](https://github.com/ole/whats-new-in-swift-4) put together by Ole Begemann.

Mike Ash has a great post on [The Best New Features in Swift 4](https://plausible.coop/blog/2017/09/13/best-new-features-in-swift-4), in case you forgot. ðŸ˜†

### Commits and pull requests

Joe Groff [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11730) his work on KeyPath subscripts. ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/908787192327135232))

### Proposals in review

[SE-0186](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0186-remove-ownership-keyword-support-in-protocols.md): *Remove ownership keyword support in protocols* by Greg Spiers is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-September/000403.html).

> This proposal removes support for the keywords `weak` and `unowned` for property declarations in a protocol.
>
> Currently it's possible to use the weak/unowned keywords for a property requirement in a protocol. This can lead to confusion as specifying one of these keywords does not enforce or raise any warnings in the adopting type of that protocol...

### Proposal drafts

Jordan Rose drafted a proposal for [non-exhaustive enums](https://github.com/jrose-apple/swift-evolution/blob/non-exhaustive-enums/proposals/nnnn-non-exhaustive-enums.md). You can find the work-in-progress [implementation here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11961). Determining how to address and design this is one part of Swift's ABI stability story.

> Currently, adding a new case to an enum is a source-breaking change, which is very inconvenient for library authors. This proposal aims to distinguish between enums that are exhaustive (meaning they will never get any new cases) and those that are non-exhaustive, and to ensure that clients handle any future cases when dealing with the latter. This change only affects clients from outside the original module.

### Mailing lists

Ted Kremenek [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-September/000402.html) Swift 4.0.

> I am pleased to announce that Swift 4.0 has been [officially released](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-0-released/).
>
> Swift 4 is available in Xcode 9 (which went live on the Mac App Store earlier today) and we will be posting an official toolchain shortly as well (likely early tomorrow morning).
>
> Official builds have been posted for Linux (Ubuntu 16.10, Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 14.04).  For those of you downloading the Linux builds, please note that there is a new signing key (search for 'Swift 4.x Release Signing Keyâ€™) on the [downloads page](ttps://swift.org/download/)
>
> Thank you to everyone who contributed to making this release happen!
