    heading: The easiest way to create your own UI controls for iOS
    body: Unfortunately, there is no standard components in iOS to compose drawings, so we are forced to use cumbersome rendering directly on graphics context.  Community of iOS developers on Github offers several frameworks to describe graphic components as a scene of primitives. Nowadays, Macaw is the most powerful framework allowing you to create custom components, charts, diagrams and use SVG files. It's an open source project with 4K+ starts on Github, so take it, use it, and make your life easier.
