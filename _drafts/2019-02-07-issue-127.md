    heading: The easiest way to create your own UI controls for iOS
    body: Unfortunately, there is no standard components in iOS to compose drawings, so we are forced to use cumbersome rendering directly on graphics context.  Community of iOS developers on Github offers several frameworks to describe graphic components as a scene of primitives. Nowadays, Macaw is the most powerful framework allowing you to create custom components, charts, diagrams and use SVG files. It's an open source project with 4K+ starts on Github, so take it, use it, and make your life easier.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-9738](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9738) [Compiler] Poor error message when calling @dynamicCallable with incorrect parameter types
- [SR-9781](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9781) [Compiler] Crash on concrete typealias access through existential metatype
- [SR-9784](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9784) [Compiler] Crash on accessing type alias through protocol-type instance
- [SR-9789](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9789) [Compiler] Use "pretty" nullability in generated ObjC headers

### Podcasts

On Swift Unwrapped, Jesse and JP discuss [Key Path Expressions as Functions](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/262630).

On the Swift Community Podcast, Garric, Chris and myself discuss [Scaling A Codeless Open Source Swift Community](https://www.swiftcommunitypodcast.org/episodes/2).

### News and community

Apple released the first Xcode 10.2 beta some time ago. The [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_2_beta_release_notes/swift_5_release_notes_for_xcode_10_2_beta)
are now available on the website, without having to login to access the PDF anymore!

### Commits and pull requests

[Rintaro Ishizaki](https://twitter.com/rintaro) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/22177)
that fixes a SourceKit regression in Swift 5 — within about 12 hours after it
was reported!

### Proposals in review

[SE-0241](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0241-string-index-explicit-encoding-offset.md): *Deprecate String Index Encoded Offsets* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0241-explicit-encoded-offsets-for-string-indices/19929).

> [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md) introduced a computed variable and initializer surrounding the concept of an `encodedOffset` for serialization purposes. Unfortunately, that approach is flawed for its intended purpose and is commonly misused in ways that Swift 5 is [more likely to expose](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9749). It is too late in the Swift 5.0 release to solve all existing problems, so we propose deprecating `encodedOffset` and introducing a targeted, semantics-preserving alternative.

> Unfortunately, [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)’s approach of a single notion of `encodedOffset` is flawed. A string can be serialized with a choice of encodings, and the offset is therefore encoding-dependent and requires access to the contents of the string to calculate. A comment in [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)’s example source mentioned that `encodedOffset` assumes UTF-16, which happened to be the only encoding used internally by String at the time (for offset purposes).
>
> Furthermore, the majority of uses of `encodedOffset` in the wild are not following [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)’s intended purpose and are sensitive to encoding changes. `encodedOffset` is frequently misused under the assumption that all Characters are comprised of a single code unit, which is error-prone and Swift 5 might surface the underlying bugs in more situations. It is also sometimes used for mapping Cocoa string indices, which happens to work in Swift 4 but might not in Swift 5, and Foundation already provides better alternatives.
