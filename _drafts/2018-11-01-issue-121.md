### Starter tasks

- [SR-8937](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8937) [Compiler] Switch over `T?` fixit does not use syntactic sugar
- [SR-8960](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8960) [Compiler] Emit a symbol reference to ensure swiftrt.o is linked on Linux/Windows

### News and community

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r/) shared [that SwiftPM can now generate code coverage data](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r/status/1055190174231973889)!

### Commits and pull requests

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/19947) that replaces one of the last remaining places where curry levels were still used by diagnostics.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0230](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0230-flatten-optional-try.md): *Flatten nested optionals resulting from `try?`* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-230-flatten-nested-optionals-resulting-from-try/17376).

> The Core Team does not want to make source-incompatible changes lightly, but we also want to leave room to improve the language for future users of Swift. We don't have a bright-line rule for when a change crosses the line to become unacceptable, but the key consideration in our analysis is the change's apparent impact in practice on existing code more than its hypothetical risks. In this case, we are convinced that the change leads to fairly inarguably better results.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0232](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0232-remove-customization-points.md): *Remove Some Customization Points from the Standard Library's `Collection` Hierarchy* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0232-remove-some-customization-points-from-the-standard-librarys-collection-hierarchy/17265).

> This proposal removes four customization points from protocols in the
standard library:
>
> - `map`, `filter`, and `forEach` from `Sequence`
> - `first`,  `prefix(upTo:)`, `prefix(through:)`, and `suffix(from:)` from `Collection`
> - `last` on `BidirectionalCollection`
>
> The default implementations of these symbols will remain, so sequences and
> collections will continue to have the same operations available that they
> do today.
