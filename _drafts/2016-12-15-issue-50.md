Welcome to the 50th issue of the weekly! It's hard to believe we've reached this milestone! ðŸ˜Š

This week Ted Kremenek wrote an official post on the [3.1 release process](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-1-release-process/). Swift 3.1 is intended to be source compatible with Swift 3.0 and set for release in Spring 2017. (Spring for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere. ðŸ˜‰) The final date to accept major changes for Swift 3.1 will be around January 16, 2017. As Chris Lattner [noted](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/807368728048324608): *"Swift 3.1 is the first release to benefit from the new era of source compatibility, a result of swift-evolution refining and polishing 3.0!"*

Soroush Khanlou wrote a post on [*Guarding Against Long Compiles*](http://khanlou.com/2016/12/guarding-against-long-compiles/). It turns out that it's pretty easy to have Xcode generate warnings for functions that take too long to type-check.

The video for Mike Ash's talk [*Exploring Swift Memory Layout*](https://realm.io/news/goto-mike-ash-exploring-swift-memory-layout/) at GOTO Copenhagen 2016 is now online. As always, Mike does a great job explaining complex topics.
