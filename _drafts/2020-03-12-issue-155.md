### Podcasts

In episode 85 of Swift Unwrapped, Jesse and JP talk [about Swift on Windows and other news](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/317221).

### News and community

[Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn/) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/argument-parser/) on Swift.org,
announcing ArgumentParser, an open-source library that makes it straightforward
— even enjoyable! — to parse command-line arguments in Swift.

Swift 5.1.5 [has been released](https://swift.org/download/).

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30174)
that adds `switch` statement support to function builders!

In that pull request, Doug pushed [a commit](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ea8d143f6425e4db7ba78df82776cc075add1e22)
after a code review from [John McCall](https://twitter.com/pathofshrines) who
noted a subtle omission in constraint generation that affected the semantics of
switch statements in function builders.

Yay for code review. @pathofshrines noted a subtle omission in constraint generation that affected the semantics of switch statements in function builders. The fix was trivial but the implications are really interesting

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) and [Tim K](https://github.com/tbkka) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30329) that provides a speedup for bridging
ObjC collections containing NSStrings.

[Kuba (Brecka) Mracek](https://twitter.com/kubamracek) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30112),
upstreaming arm64e support for Swift.

Also:

> this means we finally won’t have a billion arm64e merge conflicts every
single week

Pretty neat!

### Proposals in review

[SE-0280](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses.md): *Enum cases as protocol witnesses* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses/34257).

> The aim of this proposal is to lift an existing restriction, which is that
enum cases cannot participate in protocol witness matching.
>
> Currently, Swift has a very restrictive protocol witness matching model where
a protocol witness has to match _exactly_ with the requirement, with some
exceptions (see [Protocol Witness Matching Manifesto](https://forums.swift.org/t/protocol-witness-matching-mini-manifesto/32752)).

[SE-0279](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md): *Multiple Trailing Closures* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0279-multiple-trailing-closures/34255).

> Since its inception, Swift has supported _trailing closure_ syntax, which is
a bit of syntactic sugar that makes passing closures more ergonomic. Trailing
closures have always had two restrictions that limited their applicability.
First, that any call is limited to a single trailing closure, making the
feature awkward or even unusable when an API has more than one callback. This
limitation was noticed [very early on in Swift's
lifetime](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-trailing-closure-syntax/) as
"the" problem with trailing closure syntax. Second, that a trailing closure
argument does not provide an argument label, which can lead to call sites that
are less clear. This proposal removes both restrictions by providing an
unambiguous syntax for providing multiple, labeled trailing closures in a call,
leading to clearer and more consistent code.
