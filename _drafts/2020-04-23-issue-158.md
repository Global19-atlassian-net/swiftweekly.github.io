It still feels strange to me that every time I start writing this introduction,
I think about the two weeks that have just flown by. It makes me appreciate
how valuable time can be, and makes it feel worth it to provide all of you with
an overview of what's been happening in the "world of Swift".

I also want to give another massive _thank you_ to [Kristaps](https://twitter.com/fassko),
whose contributions are what make it possible for me to continue writing these
issues.

I'd like to encourage you to stand still and reach out to or thank someone that
has been helping you â€” speaking from my experience, it really makes a
difference.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0281](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0281-main-attribute.md): *`@main`: Type-Based Program Entry Points* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0281-main-type-based-program-entry-points/35400).

> The feedback was generally positive and the proposal has been accepted with
one minor revision: the `main()` signature will be throwing.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0282](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0282-atomics.md): *Low-Level Atomic Operations* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0282-low-level-atomic-operations/35382).

> This proposal adds a limited set of low-level atomic operations to the
Standard Library, including native spellings for C++-style memory orderings.
Our goal is to enable intrepid library authors to start building synchronization
constructs directly in Swift.
>
> In Swift today, application developers use dispatch queues and Foundation's
`NSLocking` protocol to synchronize access to mutable state across concurrent
threads of execution.
>
> However, for Swift to be successful as a systems programming language, it
needs to also provide low-level primitives that can be used to implement such
synchronization constructs (and many more!) directly within Swift.

[SE-0279](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md): *Multiple Trailing Closures* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0279-multiple-trailing-closures-amended/35435).

> This is the second review, with a modified proposal. The core team has
considered the feedback from the first review and believes that:
>
> - the underlying motivation for the proposal _does_ merit a change to the
language to better accommodate multiple trailing closures;
> - the concerns around the original proposed syntax warranted a rethink of the
proposed solution.
>
> The proposal authors have a revised proposal that aims to address some of
those concerns.
