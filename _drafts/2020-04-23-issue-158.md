### Accepted proposals

[SE-0281](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0281-main-attribute.md): *`@main`: Type-Based Program Entry Points* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0281-main-type-based-program-entry-points/35400).

> The feedback was generally positive and the proposal has been accepted with
one minor revision: the `main()` signature will be throwing.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0282](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0282-atomics.md): *Low-Level Atomic Operations* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0282-low-level-atomic-operations/35382).

> This proposal adds a limited set of low-level atomic operations to the
Standard Library, including native spellings for C++-style memory orderings.
Our goal is to enable intrepid library authors to start building synchronization
constructs directly in Swift.
>
> In Swift today, application developers use dispatch queues and Foundation's
`NSLocking` protocol to synchronize access to mutable state across concurrent
threads of execution.
>
> However, for Swift to be successful as a systems programming language, it
needs to also provide low-level primitives that can be used to implement such
synchronization constructs (and many more!) directly within Swift.

[SE-0279](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md): *Multiple Trailing Closures* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0279-multiple-trailing-closures-amended/35435).

> This is the second review, with a modified proposal. The core team has
considered the feedback from the first review and believes that:
>
> - the underlying motivation for the proposal _does_ merit a change to the
language to better accommodate multiple trailing closures;
> - the concerns around the original proposed syntax warranted a rethink of the
proposed solution.
>
> The proposal authors have a revised proposal that aims to address some of
those concerns.
