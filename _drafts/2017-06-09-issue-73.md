### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 14: [What's new in Swift, Part 1](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/70808)

We discuss some of the new features and improvements in Swift 4!

### News and community

Apple [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/06/swift-playgrounds-expands-coding-education-to-robots-drones-and-musical-instruments/) that Swift Playgrounds is gaining support for programming toy robots and drones. They are partnering with a number of companies, like Lego, Sphero, and many more. This is pretty amazing and looks super fun. You can find a [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7926MzvXOQ).

Erica Sadun's book, [Swift Style](http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/01/swift-style-wwdc-sale/), is on sale this week.

### Commits and pull requests

Roman Levenstein [make some minor tweaks](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10096) to reduce the code size of the Standard Library by 1.5 percent!

### Proposals in review

[SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md): *String Index Overhaul* by Dave Abrahams is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-June/000384.html)

> Today `String` shares an `Index` type with its `CharacterView` but not with its `UTF8View`, `UTF16View`, or `UnicodeScalarView`.  This proposal redefines `String.UTF8View.Index`, `String.UTF16View.Index`, and `String.CharacterView.Index` as typealiases for `String.Index`, and exposes a public `encodedOffset` property and initializer that can be used to serialize and deserialize positions in a `String` or `Substring`.
>
> [...]
>
> The result is a great deal of API surface area for apparently little gain in ordinary code, that normally only interchanges indices among views when the positions match up exactly (i.e. when the conversion is going to succeed).  Also, the resulting code is needlessly awkward.
>
> [...]
>
> All `String` views will use a single index type (`String.Index`), so that positions can be interchanged without awkward explicit conversions.

### Mailing lists

Rick Ballard [sent out an update](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170605/037002.html) on the Swift 4 package manager:

> Hello Swift Package Manager community,
>
> I'd like to give you an update on the state of SwiftPM in Swift 4. We've implemented a number of evolution proposal this Spring:
>
> - [SE-0152](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0152-package-manager-tools-version.md) [...]
> - [SE-0158](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0158-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign.md) [...]
> - [SE-0151](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0151-package-manager-swift-language-compatibility-version.md) [...]
> - [SE-0146](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0146-package-manager-product-definitions.md) [...]
> - [SE-0175](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0175-package-manager-revised-dependency-resolution.md) [...]
> - [SE-0150](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0150-package-manager-branch-support.md) [...]
> - [SE-0162](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0162-package-manager-custom-target-layouts.md) [...]
> - [SE-0149](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0149-package-manager-top-of-tree.md) [...]
>
> In addition to these proposals, we've made other significant improvements:
>
> - On macOS, package manifest interpretation and the package build are now sandboxed, to help mitigate the effects of maliciously crafted manifests.
> - Many error messages and diagnostics have been improved, including information about conflicts during dependency resolution.
> - Xcode project generation has been improved, and now allows schemes to reference package targets across regenerations of the project.
> - There have been a host of smaller improvements and bugfixes.
>
> Xcode 9 lays the groundwork for first-class, native support in Xcode for Swift packages with the preview version of its new build system. This build system provides the flexibility and extensibility needed to allow Xcode to support new build models, such as Swift packages. Additionally, considerable work has gone into the SwiftPM library vended by the SwiftPM project, which will support integrating Swift packages into tools like Xcode.
>
> So what's left in SwiftPM 4? First, we will be implementing [SE-0179](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0179-swift-run-command.md), support for a `swift package run` command. Beyond that, we expect to start winding down this release and looking ahead to the next, though we are still open to suggestions or evolution proposals for modest features and fixes.
>
> [...]
>
> Other features we will likely consider for the next release cycle include support for package resources (such as image assets), license and metadata support, explicit support for handling source control forking, and a generic mechanism for invoking build tools that the package manager doesn't natively support. Finally, we do anticipate supporting a centralized package index at some point in the future, and we may begin laying the groundwork for that in the upcoming year.
