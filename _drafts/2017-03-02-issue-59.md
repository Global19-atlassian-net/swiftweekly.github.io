What happened since last week other than [the Internet](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/) bursting [into flames](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html)? Let's find out! ðŸ˜„

### News and community

The Mozilla mobile team [wrote about their migration to Swift 3.0](https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/ios/firefox/swift/core/2017/02/22/migrating-to-swift-3.0.html) for [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios). It's another in-depth look from the community at the pain, sweat, and tears involved in migrating. If we're lucky, this will be one of the last posts we see like this. The unique thing about Firefox is that the entire app is [open source](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios), so you see the details up close. The good news, however, is that future versions of the Swift compiler (beginning with 3.1) will feature a "compatibility mode" which should help ease these kinds of transitions &mdash; not to mention, source-breaking changes now undergo much more scrutiny.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0154](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0154-dictionary-key-and-value-collections.md): *Provide Custom Collections for Dictionary Keys and Values* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000324.html) for Swift 4.

> Feedback was generally positive, and the core team felt that this proposal was a useful step forward for `Dictionary`, providing more flexibility for the standard library ABI and better performance. However, the core team noted that acceptance of this proposal should not preclude improvements to the ergonomics of `Dictionary`, even for the use cases described in the proposal itself (e.g., inserting an empty collection if it isnâ€™t already there, and appending a value to the collection).
