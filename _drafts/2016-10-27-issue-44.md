### Rejected proposals

Proposal [SE-0144](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0144-allow-single-dollar-sign-as-valid-identifier.md): *Allow Single Dollar Sign as a Valid Identifier* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-October/000292.html).

> The majority of the feedback on this proposal was opposed to it, because it makes the Swift language complex for a single library.  While it is unfortunate that this library is out in the wild and that there are some users, it was never intended for a single dollar sign to be allowed as an identifier, and it was also never documented as such.  The core team believes that Swift 3 compatibility mode will be able to cleanly handle compatibility issues implied by not accepting this proposal.
