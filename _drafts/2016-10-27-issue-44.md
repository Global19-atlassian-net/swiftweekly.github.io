### Commits and pull requests

Doug Gregor [committed](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/7519d83007443fd8092a20b700d5478a3cbeab5a) [a number](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5419) [of diffs](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5421) to improve the constraint solver by lazily creating constraints. This work prevents preallocating constraints that will be immediately simplified anyway &mdash; which should bring some decent performance improvements to the compiler.

In light of the rejection of [SE-0144](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0144-allow-single-dollar-sign-as-valid-identifier.md), Robert Widmann submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5270) to disable the ability to use `$` as an identifier. It looks like Swift 3 point releases will continue to silently accept `$` as an identifier, but this will be an error in Swift 4.

Erik Eckstein [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5400) a bug where a constructor call of an `open class` is devirtualized although the call should be done dynamically.

**@hyp** [patched](https://github.com/apple/swift-clang/pull/34) swift-clang to display an `objc_subclassing_restricted` error for Objective-C implementation declarations when appropriate.

Erica Sadun diligently helped to update and [maintain](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5427) the Swift changelog.

**@kstaring** opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4804) with a patch for FreeBSD compatibility.

### Rejected proposals

Proposal [SE-0144](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0144-allow-single-dollar-sign-as-valid-identifier.md): *Allow Single Dollar Sign as a Valid Identifier* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-October/000292.html).

> The majority of the feedback on this proposal was opposed to it, because it makes the Swift language complex for a single library.  While it is unfortunate that this library is out in the wild and that there are some users, it was never intended for a single dollar sign to be allowed as an identifier, and it was also never documented as such.  The core team believes that Swift 3 compatibility mode will be able to cleanly handle compatibility issues implied by not accepting this proposal.
