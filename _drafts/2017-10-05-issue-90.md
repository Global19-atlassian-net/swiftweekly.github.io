### Accepted proposals

[SE-0186](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0186-remove-ownership-keyword-support-in-protocols.md): *Remove ownership keyword support in protocols* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-September/000404.html).

> Feedback for the proposal — which many interpreted as being mostly a compiler bug fix — was limited but unanimously positive. The consensus was that removing the support for these ownership keywords in protocols removes false expectations on their behavior, which could be a source of bugs.
