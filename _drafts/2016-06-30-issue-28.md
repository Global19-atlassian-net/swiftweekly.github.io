Welcome to issue #28! This week the [Swift 3.0 preview 2 branch](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/swift-3.0-preview-2-branch) was cut on GitHub and there's a new [milestone](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?q=milestone%3A%22Swift+3.0+Preview+2%22) tracking pull requests to include.

### Commits and pull requests

Saleem Abdulrasool opened a pull request to add [PS4 support](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3221).

Rintaro Ishizaki [improved](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3184) diagnostics for a trailing closure in a condition statement.

Jamal Rogers resolved [SR-1048](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1048), a longstanding starter task to support building and testing debug and release builds of swift-corelibs-xctest.

Rintaro Ishizaki [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3246) proposal [SE-0060](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0060-defaulted-parameter-order.md): Enforcing order of defaulted parameters.

Robert Widmann [started work](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3178) on enabling leaks tracking for the stblib.

### Accepted proposals

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0106](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0106-rename-osx-to-macos.md): *Add a `macOS` Alias for the `OSX` Platform Configuration Test* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000193.html).

> The core team is proactively accepting SE-0106 "Add a macOS Alias for the OSX Platform Configuration Test” without a formal review, under the rationale that the proposal is “obvious” and probably should have been treated as a bug fix.  Adding aliases for other uses of “OS X” in the language to use macOS are also proactively accepted.

### Proposals in review

Andrew Trick's proposal, [SE-0107](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0107-unsaferawpointer.md): *UnsafeRawPointer API* is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000194.html).

> Swift enforces type safe access to memory and follows strict aliasing rules. However, code that uses unsafe APIs or imported types can circumvent the language's natural type safety. [...]
>
> Swift already protects against undefined behavior as long as the code does not use "unsafe" constructs. However, `UnsafePointer` is an important API for interoperability and building high performance data structures. As such, the rules for safe, well-defined usage of the API should be clear. Currently, it is too easy to use `UnsafePointer` improperly.

Anton Zhilin's and Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0109](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0109-remove-boolean.md): *Remove the `Boolean` protocol*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000195.html).

> For legacy and historical reasons Swift has supported a protocol named `Boolean` for abstracting over different concrete Boolean types.  This causes problems primarily because it is pointless and very confusing to newcomers to Swift: is quite different than `Bool`, but shows up right next to it in documentation and  code completion.  Once you know that it is something you don't want, you constantly ignore it. Boolean values are simple enough that we don't need a protocol to abstract over multiple concrete implementations.
>
> From a historical perspective, it was a very early solution to the bridging challenge of `BOOL` (which comes in as `ObjCBool`).  In the time since then, Swift has developed a number of more advanced ways to solve these sorts of bridging problems, and `BOOL` is already bridged in automatically as `Bool` in almost all cases.
>
> Another pragmatic problem with the `Boolean` protocol is that it isn't used consistently in APIs that take Boolean parameters: almost everything takes `Bool` concretely.  This means that its supposed abstraction isn't useful. The only significant users are the unary `!`, and binary `&&` and `||` operators.
