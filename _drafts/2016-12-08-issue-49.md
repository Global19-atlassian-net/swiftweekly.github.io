Welcome to issue 49! As of December 3, Swift has been [open source for 1 full year](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/805076141157404672). ðŸ˜± ðŸŽ‚ Can you believe it? I'm not sure if it is harder to believe that this was Swift's *first year* of open source development, or that it has *only been 1 year*. Congrats to the Core Team, contributors, and community!

### Starter tasks

### News and community

Ole Begemann wrote an article on [*The RawRepresentable Protocol in Swift*](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/11/rawrepresentable/). If you didn't know, `RawRepresentable` isn't limited to only `enum` types! Great read.

### Commits and pull requests

Robert Widmann [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5778) proposal [SE-0075](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0075-import-test.md): *Adding a Build Configuration Import Test*.

David Jones [further improved](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/723) the performance of JSON serialization on Linux in corelibs-foundation. It looks like improvements range from 1.2-2.2x speed ups.
