Swift officially turned [two years old](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/937421502101602304) this week, which means this newsletter is also two years old! It's hard to believe. We've certainly come a long way, but there's plenty of work to be done. Here's to another great year!

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 38: Off to the races](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/97828). Think thread safety with Swift is the same as C languages, with slightly different syntax? Think again!

### News and community

From [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/937421502101602304):

> Two years ago today Swift became open source.  Thank you to everyone who has (and continues) to contribute to Swift to make it a vibrant project.

Xcode 9.2 [was released](https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=12042017b), which ships with Swift 4.0.2. [Slava Pestov noted](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/938161436693446656):

> Xcode 9.2 ships with Swift 4.0.2 which includes a large number of bug fixes, including several that yâ€™all reported on Twitter

From [Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r/status/936386272318197760):

> If you write Swift scripts, add swiftpm as a dependency and try the new Utility product. It contains a nice collection of (cross platform) APIs, e.g. argument parser,  in-memory filesystem, path, terminal controller, subprocess, sorted array etc

Greg Heo wrote an article on [Swift Substrings](https://swiftunboxed.com/stdlib/substrings/) and how they're implemented. He also wrote about the implementation of [@objc and dynamic](https://swiftunboxed.com/interop/objc-dynamic/). Both are great reads!

### Commits and pull requests

Doug Gregor [made](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13178) `Codable` conformances for `Optional` and collections conditional. *"Array, Set, Dictionary, and Optional all provide unconditional conformances to Encodable & Decodable that dynamically check whether their type arguments are Encodable/Decodable. Now that we have conditional conformances, make these unconditional conformances properly conditional, removing all of the Swift 4-era type-erasure hacks."*

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0189](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0189-restrict-cross-module-struct-initializers.md): *Restrict Cross-module Struct Initializers* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-November/000414.html).

> During the review, most of the feedback voiced support that this was a necessary change for the library evolution (API resilience) story in Swift.  There was some concern about the migration impact, as the change is source-breaking.  Some options were discussed on the review thread to possibly mitigate the migration impact in some cases.  Further, the thought process is that by having a warning in Swift 4.1 we can assess the impact of the change and soft message it, or if feedback is strong, re-evaluate the change.

[SE-0191](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0191-eliminate-indexdistance.md): *Eliminate IndexDistance from Collection* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-December/000415.html).

> The proposal is accepted. Feedback for this simplification to the Collection protocols was positive.
