### Commits and pull requests

[SE-0102](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0102-noreturn-bottom-type.md) has been [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3658) by Slava Pestov. This replaces the `@noreturn` attribute with a return type of `Never`:

{% highlight swift %}
// Old
@noreturn func runAndExit() { /* ... */ }

// New
func runAndExit() -> Never { /* ... */ }
{% endhighlight %}

### Rejected proposals

Proposal [SE-0119](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0119-extensions-access-modifiers.md): *Remove access modifiers from extensions* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000250.html).

> The majority of the feedback on this proposal was opposed to it, because it eliminated the useful ability to apply access control to a batch of methods and properties.
>
> Thank you to Adrian Zubarev for raising this proposal.

### Returned proposals

Proposal [SE-0126](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0126-refactor-metatypes-repurpose-t-dot-self-and-mirror.md): *Refactor Metatypes, repurpose `T.self` and `Mirror`*, was [withdrawn for revision](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000251.html).

> The authors of SE-0126 have requested that we withdraw the proposal.  The idea will be revised, return back to the “pitch” phase, and when that converges, SE-0126 will be revised.
