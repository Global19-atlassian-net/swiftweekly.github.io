With Swift 4 development wrapping up, this week the goals for Swift 5 were announced! There are a lot of things to unpack in this announcement, but two main topics stand out &mdash; ABI stability and changes to the Swift Evolution process.

First, ABI stability is not merely a goal for Swift 5, but **a requirement** for the release. Notably, this is the first Swift release to have a hard requirement like this. As Ted discussed in the email, whatever ABI we have at the end of Swift 5, that's what we're stuck with! So there you have it, no more ABI stability delays! This likely means that iOS 12 could be the first release to ship with Swift, no longer requiring application developers to bundle the Swift runtime and standard library with their apps.

Secondly, the Swift Evolution process will see substantial changes. If you recall, the Swift 4 development cycle was split up into two "phases" in an attempt to address the somewhat chaotic influx of proposals that we saw during the development of Swift 3 (many of which were not "[in theme](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/03/swift-themed-releases/)" with the release). The intention of Swift 4's phases was to keep the release focused on meeting its goals. As seen now, this did not work out exactly as expected. Thus, beginning with Swift 5 **proposals are required to have an implementation** before being officially reviewed by the Core Team. Note, this **does not** mean that the proposal author is required to implement the changes. It only specifies that an implementation must be available in order to be reviewed. So, an outside contributor could write a proposal and someone else who's excited about the changes could implement it. Another benefit of this is that we could see the *actual impact* of the proposal on real-world code and include that as part of the review process. This will hopefully avoid another debacle like the [access control controversy](http://jessesquires.local/blog/thoughts-on-swift-access-control/) of Swift 3.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-5615](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5615): Improve diagnostic "`public` modifier cannot be used in protocols"
- [SR-5614](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5614): `NS_EXTENSIBLE_STRING_ENUM` on a `typedef NSString` crashes the compiler / source editor
- [SR-5605](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5605): Parser fails on optional `#keyPath` in enum case

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 23: [ABI Stability ‚Äì Data Layout and Metadata](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/79765). Following last week's episode on the big picture of ABI Stability, we focus on two categories of decisions that need to happen to get there: data layout and metadata.

### News and community

Xcode 9 beta 5 [was released](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=07102017a), along with other betas. ([Release notes](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_9_beta_5/Release_Notes_for_Xcode_9_beta_5.pdf)).

From [Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/895097488079634433) on Twitter:

> If you have an idea for a contribution to the Swift compiler but aren't sure where to start, please don't hesitate to reach out

### Commits and pull requests

Roman Levenstein [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11380) changes to reduce the stdlib size by 200KB.

Back in [Issue #71](https://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-71/), we covered George Karpenkov's [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9450) to add support for the `-sanitize=fuzzer flag`. This was finally merged this week.

Michael Ilseman opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11373) to change `String.CharacterView` from being its own slice type to use `Substring.CharacterView` instead, as well as making it `RangeReplaceable`. *"This aligns with the goal of introducing Substring as a separate type
to avoid accidental memory 'leaks'."* The PR also removes some old Unicode 8 code.

As mentioned in detail below, Ted Kremenek officially announced the Swift 5 goals. Here's [the diff](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/9cc90f33b6659adeaf92355c359e34e6fed73254#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8) for the Swift Evolution README if you're interested.

Per the new "rules" for Swift Evolution proposals (where proposals must be accompanied by an implementation prior to formal review), there is a new label on GitHub, [core team: needs implementation](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/labels/core%20team%3A%20needs%20implementation) to denote proposals that have a lot of traction in the community and/or that the Core Team is interested in pursing. Ted Kremenek commented on two such draft proposals ([PR #707](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/707#issuecomment-321391004), [PR #705](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/705#issuecomment-321391584)). One aims to [remove ownership keyword support in protocols](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/707/files), and the other aims to [deprecate "tuple shuffle" expressions](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/705/files). Chris Lattner commented on a third ([PR #609](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/609)) which seeks to [refine identifier and operator symbology](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/609/files).

### Proposals

No updates on proposals this week! Check [the status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) for details.

### Mailing lists

As mentinoed, Ted Kremenek [officially announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170807/038645.html) the [goals for Swift 5](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/README.md) as the development cycle for Swift 4 is winding down and nearing final release. Consideration of proposals for Swift 5 begins now! üéâ
