### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 23: [ABI Stability â€“ Data Layout and Metadata](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/79765). Following last week's episode on the big picture of ABI Stability, we focus on two categories of decisions that need to happen to get there: data layout and metadata.

### News and community

Xcode 9 beta 5 [was released](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=07102017a), along with other betas. ([Release notes](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_9_beta_5/Release_Notes_for_Xcode_9_beta_5.pdf)).

### Commits and pull requests

Back in [Issue #71](https://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-71/), we covered George Karpenkov's [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9450) to add support for the `-sanitize=fuzzer flag`. This was finally merged this week.

Michael Ilseman opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11373) to change `String.CharacterView` from being its own slice type to use `Substring.CharacterView` instead, as well as making it `RangeReplaceable`. *"This aligns with the goal of introducing Substring as a separate type
to avoid accidental memory 'leaks'."* The PR also removes some old Unicode 8 code.

As mentioned in detail below, Ted Kremenek officially announced the Swift 5 goals. Here's [the diff](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/9cc90f33b6659adeaf92355c359e34e6fed73254#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8) for the Swift Evolution README if you're interested.
