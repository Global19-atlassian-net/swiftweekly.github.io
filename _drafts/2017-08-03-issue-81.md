### Swift Unwrapped

In Episode 22: [ABI Stability &mdash; The Big Picture](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/78919), we clear up some of the misconceptions around what ABI stability means, how we'll get there and why it's important.

### Proposals

Some proposal statuses [were updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/737) this week, which means the [Status Page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) should be accurate now. Currently it looks like there are 12 accepted but unimplemented proposals and one still in review.

Kelvin Ma completed and merged the first draft of [SE-0184](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-improved-pointers.md): *Improved pointers* which was pitched on the mailing lists last week. It is not yet scheduled for a review and I am highly skeptical it will even be reviewed in the Swift 4 time frame, much less implemented if it gets accepted.
