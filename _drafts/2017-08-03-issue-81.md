### Swift Unwrapped

In Episode 22: [ABI Stability &mdash; The Big Picture](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/78919), we clear up some of the misconceptions around what ABI stability means, how we'll get there and why it's important.

### Proposals

Some proposal statuses [were updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/737) this week, which means the [Status Page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) should be accurate now. Currently it looks like there are 12 accepted but unimplemented proposals and one still in review.

Kelvin Ma completed and merged the first draft of [SE-0184](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-improved-pointers.md): *Improved pointers* which was pitched on the mailing lists last week. It is not yet scheduled for a review and I am highly skeptical it will even be reviewed in the Swift 4 time frame, much less implemented if it gets accepted.

### Mailing lists

Jordan Rose sent out [a great explanation](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170731/038522.html) on `Decodable` and `required` initializers in response to a discussion on twitter. He outlines the intricacies of Swift initializers and eventually refers readers to [this doc on Initializer Problems](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/InitializerProblems.rst). TL;DR is that there's not really a great answer and initializers are hard, but there are a few potential directions to explore in the future.

> **Why you can't make someone else's class `Decodable`: a long-winded explanation of `required` initializers**

> David Hart recently [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dhartbit/status/891766239340748800) if there was a good way to add `Decodable` support to somebody else's class. The short answer is "no, because you don't control all the subclasses", but David already understood that and wanted to know if there was anything working to mitigate the problem. So I decided to write up a long email about it instead. (Well, actually I decided to write a short email and then failed at doing so.)

Nicole Jacque [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170731/038521.html) some planned downtown for Swift.org:

> We will have some downtime for [swift.org](http://swift.org/) resources over the weekend as we upgrade our infrastructure.
