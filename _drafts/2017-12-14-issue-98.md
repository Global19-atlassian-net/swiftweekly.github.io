### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 39](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/99551): *Source Compatibility Suite Woes*. The source compatibility suite has been useful in catching compatibility issues before official Swift releases are cut, but it leaves much to be desired especially around communication with project maintainers outside Apple.

### News and community

Ole Begemann wrote a great post, [Why Dictionary sometimes encodes itself as an array](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/12/dictionary-codable-array/). Read on to found out!

From [Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/941087094994214912):

> Moving from Swift 3 to 4, you may get "overriding declarations in extensions is not supported" errors. Before you panic and refactor everything, try adding `ï¹«objc` back to class extensions.

### Commits and pull requests

Slava Pestov continued his work on class resilience [here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13312) and [here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13338).

Ben Cohen opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13323) to eliminate `ArraySlice` from the std lib in favor of using `Slice` with conditional conformances.

Slava Pestov [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13351) an issue regarding non-polymorphic constructors.

### Proposal pitches

Nate Cook [drafted](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/773) a proposal for adding `last(where:)` and `lastIndex(where:)` to `Sequence` and `Collection`. You can view the [draft here](https://github.com/natecook1000/swift-evolution/blob/31a84514aea6e3a05a685d31249dca7c20001f41/proposals/0000-add-last-methods.md) and the [implementation here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13337).

> The standard library should include methods for finding the last element in a sequence, and the index of the last element in a collection, that match a given predicate.
>
> The standard library currently has methods that perform a linear search to find an element or the index of an element that matches a predicate: [...]
>
> Unfortunately, there are no such methods that search from the end. Finding the last of a particular kind of element has multiple applications, particularly with text, such as wrapping a long string into lines of a maximum length or trimming whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
>
> You can work around this limitation by using the methods above on a reversed view of a collection, but the resulting code is frankly appalling.

Chris Lattner opened [a new pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/774) with a revision of his DynamicMemberLookup proposal. View the [draft here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/40abd6fc5ff4e11fb73ba02cad9a7682a3f5a41f/proposals/XXXX-dynamic-member-lookup.md) and [implementation here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13361).

> This proposal introduces a new `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` type to the standard library. Types that conform to it provide "dot" syntax for arbitrary names which are resolved at runtime - in a **completely type safe** way. It is simple syntactic sugar which has a non-invasive implementation in the compiler.
