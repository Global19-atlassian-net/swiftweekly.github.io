[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) shared [some thoughts](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-representation-of-polymorphic-interfaces-in-sil-with-substituted-function-types/29711)
on improving the representation of polymorphic interfaces in SIL with
"substituted function types".

> Swift Intermediate Language (SIL) has a lot of incidental complexity arising
from representational issues in how we handle the types of
polymorphically-callable functions such as protocol witnesses, class methods,
and closures. Here is a proposed design for substituted function types, which
tries to address some of these issues.
>
> To implement a polymorphic interface, such as a protocol method or class
method, the different implementations have to share a common generic
machine-level calling convention, even though each implementation has a
different concrete function type derived from the specific parent type it
provides an implementation for.
