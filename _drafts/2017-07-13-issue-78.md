### Accepted proposals

[SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md): *String Index Overhaul* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170703/037942.html).

> The proposal is accepted. There was a lively discussion about it, but in the end everyone seems to agree that this is the right thing to do.
>
> As always, I'd like to thank you for your help in making Swift a better language.

### Mailing lists

Younes Manton [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170710/037970.html) announcing a prototype JIT compiler for server-side Swift, created by a small group of developers from the IBM Runtimes compiler team:

> Last year a small group of developers from the IBM Runtimes compiler team
undertook a project to explore JIT compilation for Swift, primarily aimed
at server-side Swift. The compilation model we settled on was a hybrid
approach that combined static compilation via swiftc with dynamic
compilation via a prototype JIT compiler based on Eclipse OMR. [1]
>
> This prototype JIT compiler (targeting Linux specifically) functioned by
having itself loaded by a Swift process at runtime, patching Swift
functions so that they may be intercepted, recompiling them from their SIL
representations, and redirecting callers to the JIT compiled version. In
order to accomplish this we needed to make some changes to the static
compiler and the target program's build process.
>
> [...]
>
> (As for the prototype itself, we intend to open source it either in its
current state [based on Swift 3.0 and an early version of OMR] or in a more
up-to-date state in the very near future.)
