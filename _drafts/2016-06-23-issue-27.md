### Starter tasks

Support for [running the Swift test suite on Android](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1714) was merged during WWDC, and there are a lot of improvements that can still be made. If you have an Ubuntu 15.10 development environment and an Android device, these may be a great way to get started to contributing to Swift on Android:

- [SR-1748](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1748): Make it possible to run the Swift test suite on an Android emulator, instead of a real device.
- [SR-1749](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1749): Allow contributors to run only tests that require an Android device, or all the tests that don't require one.
- [SR-1835](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1835): Fix a test failure that occurs when referencing `stdout` on Android.
- [SR-1836](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1836): Fix several reflection test failures on Android, by addressing a linker error.
