Apple [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/06/swift-playgrounds-expands-coding-education-to-robots-drones-and-musical-instruments/) that Swift Playgrounds is gaining support for programming toy robots and drones.

Erica Sadun's book, [Swift Style](http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/01/swift-style-wwdc-sale/), is on sale this week.
