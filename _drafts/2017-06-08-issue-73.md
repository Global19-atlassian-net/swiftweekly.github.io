### Swift Unwrapped

> TODO: Latest episode of Swift Unwrapped

### News and community

Apple [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/06/swift-playgrounds-expands-coding-education-to-robots-drones-and-musical-instruments/) that Swift Playgrounds is gaining support for programming toy robots and drones. They are partnering with a number of companies, like Lego and Sphero. This is pretty amazing and looks super fun. You can find a [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7926MzvXOQ).

Erica Sadun's book, [Swift Style](http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/01/swift-style-wwdc-sale/), is on sale this week.

### Commits and pull requests

Roman Levenstein [make some minor tweaks](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10096) to reduce the code size of the Standard Library by 1.5 percent!

### Proposals in review

[SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md): *String Index Overhaul* by Dave Abrahams is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-June/000384.html)

> Today `String` shares an `Index` type with its `CharacterView` but not with its `UTF8View`, `UTF16View`, or `UnicodeScalarView`.  This proposal redefines `String.UTF8View.Index`, `String.UTF16View.Index`, and `String.CharacterView.Index` as typealiases for `String.Index`, and exposes a public `encodedOffset` property and initializer that can be used to serialize and deserialize positions in a `String` or `Substring`.
>
> [...]
>
> The result is a great deal of API surface area for apparently little gain in ordinary code, that normally only interchanges indices among views when the positions match up exactly (i.e. when the conversion is going to succeed).  Also, the resulting code is needlessly awkward.
>
> [...]
>
> All `String` views will use a single index type (`String.Index`), so that positions can be interchanged without awkward explicit conversions.
