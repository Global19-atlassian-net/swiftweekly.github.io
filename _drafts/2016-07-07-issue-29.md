Welcome to issue #29! This week Xcode 8 beta 2 [was released](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=07052016b) and *a lot* of proposals went into review. There are well over 100 proposals now. It's hard to believe we've seen so many in such a relatively short time!

Patrick Pijnappel [refactored](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3287) `UTF8.decode(_:)` and `UTF16.decode(_:)` for speed-ups based on the iterator nil-guarantee introduced in [SE-0052](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0052-iterator-post-nil-guarantee.md). 😎

Harlan Haskins [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3335) a fixit for a misplaced `throws`, which corrects `func f() -> throws T` to `func f() throws -> T`. 👌

Ankit Agarwal [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/460) support for parallel test execution in SwiftPM. 🎉

Josef Willsher [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3293) proposal [SE-0095](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0095-any-as-existential.md): *Replace `protocol<P1,P2>` syntax with `P1 & P2` syntax*. 👏
