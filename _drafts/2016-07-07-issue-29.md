Welcome to issue #29! This week Xcode 8 beta 2 [was released](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=07052016b) and *a lot* of proposals went into review. There are well over 100 proposals now. It's hard to believe we've seen so many in such a relatively short time!

### Commits and pull requests

Patrick Pijnappel [refactored](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3287) `UTF8.decode(_:)` and `UTF16.decode(_:)` for speed-ups based on the iterator nil-guarantee introduced in [SE-0052](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0052-iterator-post-nil-guarantee.md). 😎

Harlan Haskins [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3335) a fixit for a misplaced `throws`, which corrects `func f() -> throws T` to `func f() throws -> T`. 👌

Ankit Agarwal [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/460) support for parallel test execution in SwiftPM. 🎉

Josef Willsher [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3293) proposal [SE-0095](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0095-any-as-existential.md): *Replace `protocol<P1,P2>` syntax with `P1 & P2` syntax*. 👏

**@practicalswift** [found](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3345) [two more](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3359) compiler crashers and added test cases for them. 💥

### Accepted proposals

Trent Nadeau's proposal, [SE-0103](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0103-make-noescape-default.md): *Make non-escaping closures the default*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000204.html).

> The proposal is *accepted* for Swift 3 with a minor revision: instead of a `asUnsafeEscapingClosure(_:)` function that removes the `@escaping` attribute, the core team prefers a function with this signature (roughly) like:

{% highlight swift %}
func withoutActuallyEscaping<ClosureType, ResultType>(_ closure: ClosureType, do: (fn : @escaping ClosureType) -> ResultType) -> ResultType {
   // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

> This allows one to safely add the `@escaping` attribute in situations where a closure is known not to actually escape.  For example, in a situation where you might want to use a lazy algorithm, you could use:

{% highlight swift %}
func yourFunction(fn : (Int) -> Int) {  // fn defaults to non-escaping.
   withoutActuallyEscaping(fn) { fn in  // fn is now marked @escaping inside the closure
   ... somearray.lazy.map(fn)           // pass fn to something that is notationally @escaping
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

> The key to this approach is that the `withoutActuallyEscaping` function can verify that the closure has not actually escaped when it completes, providing a safe model for locally adding the `@escaping` attribute when needed.  The core team believes that the actual implementation of `withoutActuallyEscaping` will require some magic, but that it should be implementable.

> Many thanks to Trent Nadeau for driving this proposal forward.  I filed [SR-1952](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1952) to track implementation of this feature.

Joe Groff's proposal, [SE-0102](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0102-noreturn-bottom-type.md): *Remove `@noreturn` attribute and introduce an empty `Never` type*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000205.html).

> The core team *accepted* the proposal for Swift 3 with a revision to change the name of the type from "NoReturn" to "Never".
>
> The feedback on the proposal was generally very positive from the community.  The only significant concern was from people who felt that merging the concept of "does not return" into the result type of the function conflates two concepts.  The core team feels that unifying these concepts overall reduces the surface area of the language by eliminating an obscure (but important) type system concept outright.
>
> The other significant discussion was about the actual name for the "NoReturn" type.  The core team enjoyed the community idea of naming it “💥" or ”🔃” but decided that the name lacked clarity.  Ultimately the core team agreed with the loud voice of the community that "Never" is the right name for this type.

Proposal [SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md): *Protocol-oriented integers* from Dave Abrahams, Dmitri Gribenko, and Maxim Moiseev, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000206.html).

> The feedback from the community was very positive and contributed a number of improvements to the design of the proposal.  The core team has accepted the proposal, subject to the following changes:
>
> - The `Integer` protocol should be renamed to `BinaryInteger` to be more accurate and avoid confusion between `Int` and `Integer`.
> - The `FloatingPoint` protocol should conform to the `Arithmetic` protocol.
> - Rename the `absoluteValue` property to `magnitude`, and sink it down to the `Arithmetic` protocol.
> - Eliminate the `AbsoluteValuable` protocol, since `abs` can now be defined in terms of `Arithmetic`.
> - Rename the `signBitIndex` property to `minimumSignedRepresentationBitWidth`.
> - Add a `popcount` property requirement to the `FixedWidthInteger` protocol.
> - Change the `countLeadingZeros()` member of concrete types to be a `leadingZeros` property on `FixedWidthInteger`.
> - Rename `func nthWord(n: Int) -> UInt` to `func word(at: Int) -> UInt`.
> - Rename the `and`, `or`, and `xor` members of `FixedWidthInteger` to `bitwiseAnd`, `bitwiseOr` and `bitwiseXor`.
> - Change `doubleWidthMultiply` to be a static member, and add a `doubleWidthDivide` member as its dual.  The latter will return both quotient and remainder of type `Self`. Both are to be added to the `FixedWidthInteger` protocol.
>
> Many thanks to Maxim Moiseev, Dave Abrahams and Dmitri Gribenko for driving this proposal forward, Steve Canon for his important input, and to Maxim Moiseev for driving the implementation work forward.

### Rejected proposals

Proposal [SE-0105](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0105-remove-where-from-forin-loops.md): *Removing Where Clauses from For-In Loops* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000199.html).

> The vast majority of the community of the community prefers to keep this language feature, and the core team agrees.  Even though ‘where’ is a small bit of syntactic sugar, it improves the expressivity (therefore readability and maintainability) of important loops.
>
> Many thanks to Erica Sadun for driving this discussion and writing the proposal.  This proposal was important and fit with an important goal of Swift 3, which is to re-evaluate all of the existing language features to make sure they are a good for the language over the long term.

### Returned proposals

Proposal [SE-0101](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0101-standardizing-sizeof-naming.md): *Reconfiguring `sizeof` and related functions into a unified `MemoryLayout` struct* was [returned for revision](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000203.html).

> The proposal is *returned for revision*, with the goal for a revised version to make it into Swift 3.  The thread discussing it has already turned towards new ways to express these ideas, so when that thread runs its course we'll restart review of the revised proposal.
