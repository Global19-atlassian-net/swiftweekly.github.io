### Accepted proposals

[SE-0242](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0242-default-values-memberwise.md): *Synthesize default values for the memberwise initializer* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0242-synthesize-default-values-for-the-memberwise-initializer/21475).

> The proposal is accepted, with a request that the original proposal be amended for clarification of actual behavior. The Core Team felt that the proposal should more explicitly illustrate the actual behavior in a few specific cases, as this was the crux of some of the back-and-forth in the review thread. Note: the proposal has been updated to include more details in the [_proposed solution_](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/b5bbc5ae1f53189641951acfd50870f5b886859e/proposals/0242-default-values-memberwise.md#proposed-solution) section, as requested by the Core Team.

### Returned proposals

[SE-0245](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0245-array-uninitialized-initializer.md): *Add an Array Initializer with Access to Uninitialized Storage* was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0245-add-an-array-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/21469) as (part of) [SE-0223](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0223-array-uninitialized-initializer.md).

> This proposal suggests a new initializer for `Array` and `ContiguousArray`
> that provides access to an array's uninitialized storage buffer.
>
> Some collection operations require working on a fixed-size buffer of uninitialized memory.
> For example, one O(*n*) algorithm for performing a stable partition of an array is as follows:
>
> 1. Create a new array the same size as the original array.
> 2. Iterate over the original array,
>    copying matching elements to the beginning of the new array
>    and non-matching elements to the end.
> 3. When finished iterating, reverse the slice of non-matching elements.
>
> Unfortunately, the standard library provides no way to create an array of a
> particular size without initializing every element. Even if we
> avoid initialization by manually allocating the memory using an
> `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`, there's no way to convert that buffer into an
> array without copying the contents. There simply isn't a way to implement this
> particular algorithm with maximum efficiency in Swift.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0247](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0247-contiguous-strings.md): *Contiguous Strings* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0247-contiguous-strings/21483).

> One of the most common API requests from performance-minded users of string is a way to get direct access to the raw underlying code units. Now that [Swift 5 uses UTF-8](https://forums.swift.org/t/string-s-abi-and-utf-8/17676) for its preferred encoding, we can provide this.
>
> “Contiguous strings” are strings that are capable of providing a pointer and length to [validly encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Invalid_byte_sequences) UTF-8 contents in constant time. Contiguous strings include:
>
> * All native Swift string forms
> * Lazily bridged Cocoa strings that provide a pointer to contiguous ASCII
> * Any “shared string” concept we may add in the future

[SE-0246](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0246-mathable.md): *Generic Math(s) Functions* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0246-generic-math-s-functions/21479).

> This proposal introduces two new protocols to the standard library: `ElementaryFunctions`
> and `Real`. These protocols combine to provide "basic math functions" in generic contexts
> for floating-point and SIMD types, and provide a path to extend that functionality to
> planned complex types in the future.
>
> `BinaryFloatingPoint` (and the protocols it refines) provides a powerful set of
> abstractions for writing numerical code, but it does not include the transcendental
> operations defined by the C math library, which are instead imported by the platform
> overlay as a set of overloaded concrete free functions.
