It has at this point already been more than two and a half weeks since WWDC
2019. While many are looking into the new tech announced there, as well as
playing with the beta software, this is what has been going on in the Swift.org
open source projects over the last two weeks.

### News and community

Woot! This is so amazing: https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha.1 . I'm super thrilled to see the first gprc-swift on top of SwiftNIOHTTP2 land.

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25449)
implementing composition of property wrappers.

[A pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25408) was merged that
makes Dictionaries to not be rewritten into a call expression after type
checking. The new way is to keep the `LiteralExpr` around and just stash a
reference to the right initializer.

[Davide Italiano](https://github.com/dcci) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb/pull/1693)
that fixes a bug by simply removing code!

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25510)
fully qualifies names for types with the same name in either different modules,
or different scopes. The diagnostic would be really confusing, and this change
improves that.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25615)
cleaning up the implementation of lazy property's underlying storage.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0258](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md): *Property Wrappers* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0258-property-wrappers-second-review/25843).

> Doug Gregor has provided the following list of differences from the previous
revision:
>
> - The name of the feature has been changed from "property delegates" to
"property wrappers" to better communicate how they work and avoid the existing
uses of the term "delegate" in the Apple developer community
> - When a property wrapper type has a no-parameter `init()`, properties that
use that wrapper type will be implicitly initialized via `init()`.
>  - Support for property wrapper composition has been added, using a "nesting"
model.
> - A property with a wrapper can no longer have an explicit get or set
declared, to match with the behavior of existing, similar features (`lazy`,
`@NSCopying`).
> - A property with a wrapper does not need to be `final`.
> - Reduced the visibility of the synthesized storage property to `private`.
> - When a wrapper type provides `wrapperValue`, the (computed) `$` variable is
internal (at most) and the backing storage variable gets the prefix `$$` (and
remains `private`).
> - Removed the restriction banning property wrappers from having names that
match the regular expression `_*[a-z].*`.
> - `Codable`, `Hashable`, and `Equatable` synthesis are now based on the
backing storage properties, which is a simpler model that gives more control to
the authors of property wrapper types.
> - Improved type inference for property wrapper types and clarified that the
type of the wrappedValue property is used as part of this inference. See the
"Type inference" section.
> - Renamed the value property to `wrappedValue` to avoid conflicts.
> - Initial values and explicitly-specified initializer arguments can both be
used together; see the `@Clamping` example.
