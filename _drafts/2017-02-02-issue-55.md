### News and community

Graydon Hoare ([@graydon](https://github.com/graydon/)), [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) creator, wrote a post on [Faster Mix-and-Match Builds with Precompiled Bridging Headers](https://swift.org/blog/bridging-pch/) for the official Swift blog. The article discusses the compile-time cost of projects that mix Objective-C and Swift and how it is being addressed in Swift 3.1. One interesting thing to note is that the team is explicitly [soliciting feedback on Twitter](https://swift.org/blog/bridging-pch/#reporting-feedback) via `#SwiftBridgingPCH`.

Paul Hudson wrote about [What's new in Swift 3.1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/swift3-1). It's a great overview with examples.

From [Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/825012717580726272):

> If your Swift code compiles in Xcode 8.2 but not in the 8.3 betas, that's our fault, not yours. Please let us know by filing bugs!

### Commits and pull requests

Colin Howell ([@colinhowell](https://github.com/colinhowell)) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7004/commits/e4ae3f03642e1c93c81b10a49e7f6b1e76333774) a source of exponential behavior with dictionary literals.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0148](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0148-generic-subscripts.md): *Generic Subscripts* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-January/000311.html) for Swift 4.

> The review of SE-0148 “Generic Subscripts” ran from January 19...24, 2017. Feedback was 100% positive, and the proposal is accepted for Swift 4, along with the amendment to support default arguments for subscript parameters. Thanks to everyone who participated!

### Mailing lists

Joshua Alvarado has [re-opened the discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170123/030646.html) on moving swift-evolution away from email toward a forum-based solution.

> It is hard to know what has already been discussed and who is even in the active conversation. Keeping track of history is a pain as well. Searching through many emails to find who said what and when is not effective in email clients. Also, code formatting in emails is not effective. Let's discuss and actually make an action to move away from email if the community so agrees.

Ole Begemann [highlighted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170123/030687.html) some common pain points with the current solution: a lack of permalinks to view messages on the web archive, the poor usability of the web archive, and readability due to people using different formatting. Austin Zheng [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170123/030942.html) potential issues with logistics, maintenance, and administrative costs.

Project Lead, Ted Kremenek, [was open to the idea](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170123/030862.html):

> I have no problem with the project moving to forums instead of the Mailman mailing lists we have now — if it is the right set of tradeoffs.
>
> My preference is to approach the topic objectively, working from goals and seeing how the mailing lists are aligning with those goals and how an alternative, such as Discourse, might do a better job.
>
> The current use of mailing lists has been carry-over of how both LLVM does public discussion (which is all mailing lists) and how the Swift team at Apple has used mailing lists for discussion.  That inertia has benefits in that it is a familiar workflow that is “proven” to work — but the doesn’t mean it is the best option going forward.

The community was mostly positive about moving away from email for swift-evolution and swift-users (other mailing lists would remain) and agreed that if moving to a forum that [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org) would likely be the best option.
