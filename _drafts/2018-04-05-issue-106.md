Thereâ€™s been plenty of news to make developers experience the full range of emotions: Xcode 9.3 with Swift 4.1 made it out of the gate, the WWDC lottery smiled on some, and caused gnashing of teeth in others.

Meanwhile, Swift 4.2 and beyond await us. As a reminder, the final merge into the Swift 4.2 branch before a soak period is [coming up in two weeks, on April 20](https://swift.org/blog/4-2-release-process/).

Whatâ€™s new in the world of Swift? Read on!

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 51](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/125760) is the long-awaited Part 2 of Doug Gregor and Ben Cohen discussing Swift 4.1.

In [Episode 52](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/129738), JP and Jesse cover two now pitches regarding Swift Package Manager.


### News and community

Languages & Runtime manager [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) shared photos of some [new office decorations over at Swift HQ](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/977268865066450944). ðŸ¤–

### Proposals in review

[SE-0201](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0201-package-manager-local-dependencies.md): _Package Manager Local Dependencies_ by [Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r) is out of its review period and [awaiting results](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0201-package-manager-local-dependencies/11286).

This proposal would allow you to declare a package dependency via a local path rather than a remote URL.


[SE-0202](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md): _Random Unification_ by [Alejandro Alonso](https://github.com/Azoy) is just out of review, [awaiting results](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0202-random-unification/11313).

This proposal adds `random()` static function to numeric types and collections, a `shuffled()` method to sequences, as well as a `shuffle()` method to mutable collections.


### Swift Forums

[Soroush Khanlou](https://twitter.com/khanlou) [pitched an addition to `Sequence`](https://forums.swift.org/t/count-where-on-sequence/11186) to provide `count(where:)`:

> While Swiftâ€™s Sequence models brings a lot of niceties that we didnâ€™t have access to in Objective-C, like `map` and `filter`, there are other useful operations on Sequences that the standard library doesnâ€™t support yet. Iâ€™d like to pitch one today: `count(where:)`, which counts the number of objects in a Sequence that passes some test.

> `[1, 2, 3, -1, -2].count(where: { $0 > 0 }) // => 3`


### Finally

I canâ€™t wait for `#error` and `#warning` to land in Swift 4.2, but in the meantime [at least thereâ€™s Swift support for `#lolcode`](https://github.com/CodaFi/swift/blob/72f19c9565ae7da1fe8bb7a4d02ff51cec9caa54/test/Interpreter/lolcode.swift). ðŸ˜¹
