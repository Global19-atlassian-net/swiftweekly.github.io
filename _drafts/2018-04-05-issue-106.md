> TK insert poem here

There’s been plenty of news to make developers experience the full range of emotions: [Xcode 9.3](https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=03292018d) with [Swift 4.1](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-1-released/) made it out of the gate, the WWDC lottery smiled on some, and caused gnashing of teeth in others.

Meanwhile, Swift 4.2 and beyond await us. As a reminder, the final merge into the Swift 4.2 branch before a soak period is [coming up in two weeks, on April 20](https://swift.org/blog/4-2-release-process/).

What’s new in the world of Swift? Read on!

### Starter tasks

- [SR-7323](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7323): SPM can't handle spaces in path to Xcode
- [SR-7307](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7307): Warn when a block contains nothing but a defer statement
- [SR-7301](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7301): Bad fixit suggested for protocol extension implementation for inherited objc protocol
- [SR-7292](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7292): Swift local refactoring: adding field-wise initializers automatically
- [SR-7266](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7266): `reversed()` applied multiple times should not nest `ReversedCollection` into itself

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 51](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/125760) is the long-awaited Part 2 of Doug Gregor and Ben Cohen discussing Swift 4.1.

In [Episode 52](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/129738), JP and Jesse cover two now pitches regarding Swift Package Manager.


### News and community

Languages & Runtime manager [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) shared photos of some [new office decorations over at Swift HQ](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/977268865066450944). 🤖

### Commits and pull requests

[Greg Titus](https://github.com/gregomni) fixed a [compiler crash](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15488) that happened when a `case` statement had both `let` and `var` [bindings for the same name](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7261).

[Stephen Canon](https://github.com/stephentyrone) merged a change to how `description` and `debugDescription` [display floating-point values](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15474). A fascinating read into a fast and simple algorithm, and be sure to check out the chart showing the performance gains! 😍

[Karoy Lorentey](https://github.com/lorentey) merged his pull request to add [conditional conformance to `Hashable` in more standard library types](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15382). Optionals, arrays, dictionaries, and ranges (among other types) can now participate in [synthesized `Hashable` conformance](https://forums.swift.org/t/amendment-se-0143-conditional-conformance-add-hashable-conformance-to-std-lib-types/11401).

[Mark Lacey](https://github.com/rudkx) landed a change to [fix type checking going exponential](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15419) for tuple literals. One fewer case of Xcode complaining that a type check took too long? ⏱

[Michael Ilseman](https://github.com/milseman) added the [new `SmallString` type to the standard library](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14755). The type is supported on 64-bit architectures and offers optimizations specific for (you guessed it) small strings.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0201](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0201-package-manager-local-dependencies.md): _Package Manager Local Dependencies_ by [Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r) is out of its review period and [awaiting results](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0201-package-manager-local-dependencies/11286).

This proposal would allow you to declare a package dependency via a local path rather than a remote URL.


[SE-0202](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md): _Random Unification_ by [Alejandro Alonso](https://github.com/Azoy) is just out of review, [awaiting results](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0202-random-unification/11313).

This proposal adds `random()` static function to numeric types and collections, a `shuffled()` method to sequences, as well as a `shuffle()` method to mutable collections.

[Joe Groff]() [suggested a proposal to add `offset(of:)` to `MemoryLayout`](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/818/files?diff=unified).

> This proposal introduces the ability for Swift code to query the in-memory layout of stored properties in aggregates using key paths.
>
> `MemoryLayout<Rect>.offset(of: \.origin.x) // => 0`
> `MemoryLayout<Rect>.offset(of: \.origin.y) // => 8`


### Swift Forums

[Soroush Khanlou](https://twitter.com/khanlou) [pitched an addition to `Sequence`](https://forums.swift.org/t/count-where-on-sequence/11186) to provide `count(where:)`:

> While Swift’s Sequence models brings a lot of niceties that we didn’t have access to in Objective-C, like `map` and `filter`, there are other useful operations on Sequences that the standard library doesn’t support yet. I’d like to pitch one today: `count(where:)`, which counts the number of objects in a Sequence that passes some test.

> `[1, 2, 3, -1, -2].count(where: { $0 > 0 }) // => 3`


[Michael Ilseman]() wrote a pitch for [character and string properties](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-character-and-string-properties/11620). This would add support for some handy computed properties such as `isWhitespace` and `isAscii` on characters, and helper structs and methods on strings to split lines and words.

Why not reach into string and character properties and do all this yourself? Short answer: Unicode is hard.

> [There] is potential harm in developers reaching for these properties to solve common tasks without understanding their deep implications in Unicode. Whenever possible, we believe the best form of harm-reduction is providing more ergonomic APIs with more appropriate semantics for these common tasks.


### Finally

I can’t wait for `#error` and `#warning` to land in Swift 4.2, but in the meantime [at least there’s Swift support for `#lolcode`](https://github.com/CodaFi/swift/blob/72f19c9565ae7da1fe8bb7a4d02ff51cec9caa54/test/Interpreter/lolcode.swift). 😹
