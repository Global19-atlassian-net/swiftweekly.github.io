### Accepted proposals

[SE-0241](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0241-string-index-explicit-encoding-offset.md): *Deprecate String Index Encoded Offsets* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0241-explicit-encoded-offsets-for-string-indices/20540).

> Feedback on the initial proposal was mostly positive, but several people expressed some reservations about some of the new API, and the authors agreed to reduce the proposal to a more minimal change. That new version generally met with approval, with a few dissents:
>
> - Some community members took the opportunity to register their disapproval of the lack of integer indexing into String. While those complaints are noted, this review was not the place to air them.
> - Lily Ballard expressed concern about the lack of structure of these encoded offsets and about their behavior when the offset does not correspond to a scalar boundary. The Core Team generally agrees with the proposal author that the offset not matching a scalar boundary is a programmer error for which trapping is consistent with Swift's general behavior on similar precondition violations.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0242](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0242-default-values-memberwise.md): *Synthesize default values for the memberwise initializer* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0242-synthesize-default-values-for-the-memberwise-initializer/20618).

> This proposal aims to solve a simple outstanding problem with the way the Swift compiler currently synthesizes the memberwise initializer for structures by synthesizing default values for properties with default initializers.
