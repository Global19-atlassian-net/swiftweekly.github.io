    heading: ! 'Forward Swift: March 2 in San Francisco + Free Online Workshop Access'
    body: Attend a full day of cutting-edge iOS talks ranging from mirroring and introspection to watchOS. Your ticket includes free networking events with speakers/other devs, and 1 free month of online workshop access post event. Add an exclusive in-person workshops by Paul Hudson on beginning or advanced Swift, macOS, and server-side Swift while they last. Use code **forward-swift-2017**.

This week there were updates from the Swift Server APIs work group, new SPM proposals, great community articles about protocols and standard library collections, and an announcement that swift-evolution (and swift-users) will be moving to [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org). Given the volume on these particular lists, and the need to easily search, reference, and rehash previous discussions, I think this will benefit the community. It looks like the initial setup and migration may require substantial effort, but the Core Team is seeking help from the community. Read on to learn more!

### Starter tasks

- [SR-3836](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3836): The `SubSequence` of a `Range` should be a `Range`
- [SR-1421](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1421): `sourcekitd-test -help` should print help, list available request types

### News and community

Chris Eidhof wrote a great post, [Classes That Conform To Protocols](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/classes-and-protocols/), that explains how to use type-erasers as a workaround until [generalized existentials](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#generalized-existentials) arrive in Swift.

Orta Therox wrote a [retrospective on using Swift at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/). It's an incredibly interesting post that actually ends up being more about the pros and cons of adopting [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) instead of converting to Swift. Most importantly, he highlights some major, systemic issues with Apple's developer tools and ecosystem &mdash; in particular the lack of openness (Radar) and lack of extensibility (Xcode).

The Swift Server APIs work group held their second security stream meeting, and [posted the meeting minutes](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/pull/72).

Daniel Duan wrote a step-by-step guide on how to [reply retroactively to an old mailing list thread](http://dduan.net/2017/02/07/replying-to-old-mailing-list-threads/) on swift-evolution. Definitely not very user friendly or efficient. This is the kind of cumbersome experience that the Core Team hopes to mitigate by moving to Discourse.

Ole Begemann wrote a great article, [Being a Mutable Collection is not Sufficient to be a `MutableCollection`](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/02/why-is-dictionary-not-a-mutablecollection/), where he dives into the standard library collection protocols and answers why `Dictionary` is (perhaps unintuitively) *not* a `MutableCollection`, among other things.

### Commits and pull requests

Dave Abrahams ([@dabrahams](https://github.com/dabrahams)) opened an initial [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6752) to rethink the existing Unicode implementation. This work is part of the [String Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/StringManifesto.md).

Erik Eckstein ([@eeckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein)) [made changes](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7274) to link a new re-mangler and de-mangler into the swift runtime library.

Slava Pestov ([@slavapestov](https://github.com/slavapestov)) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7296) an issue ([SR-3840](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3840)) where a closure that reads and writes to a computed parameter picks up the static type and not the dynamic type.

There's a [new repo](https://github.com/swift-server/security) under the [swift-server](https://github.com/swift-server) GitHub organization for the development of cross-platform Security APIs. It's currently empty except for a README, which has all of the details. It discusses the scope of the project, which SSL implementation to use, and trade-offs.

### Accepted proposals

Proposal [SE-0149](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0149-package-manager-top-of-tree.md): *Package Manager Support for Top of Tree development* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000314.html).

> The review of SE-0149 "Package Manager Support for Top of Tree development" ran from January 24...31. Feedback was positive, and the proposal is accepted for Swift 4. Thanks to everyone who participated!

Proposal [SE-0150](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0150-package-manager-branch-support.md): *Package Manager Support for branches* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000315.html).

> The review of SE-0150 "Package Manager Support for branches" ran from January 24...31. Feedback was positive, and the proposal is accepted for Swift 4. Thanks to everyone who participated!

### Proposals in review

[SE-0151](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0151-package-manager-swift-language-compatibility-version.md): *Package Manager Swift Language Compatibility Version* by Daniel Dunbar and Rick Ballard is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000316.html).

> This proposal adds support for the Swift compiler's new "language compatibility version" feature to the package manager.

[SE-0152](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0152-package-manager-tools-version.md): *Package Manager Tools Version* by Rick Ballard is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000317.html).

> This proposal introduces a "Swift tools version" which is declared for each Swift package. The tools version declares the minimum version of the Swift tools required to use the package, determines what version of the `PackageDescription` API should be used in the `Package.swift` manifest, and determines which Swift language compatibility version should be used to parse the `Package.swift` manifest.

### Mailing lists

Continuing the meta-discussions from last week about moving away from the mailing lists to [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org), Ted Kremenek [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170206/031657.html) regarding the decision from the Core Team:

> There was a long thread on swift-evolution about whether we should use modern forum software &mdash; like Discourse &mdash; as an alternative to the mailing lists we have now. After a long discussion, the Core Team has decided to move swift-evolution and swift-users to Discourse.
>
> There are tradeoffs to moving to a forum.  The main advantages are:
>
> - Easy for people to participate without subscribing to the entire mailing list, as well as no need to provide email address to participate.  A lot of people have voiced concern that they feel resistance to participate because of needing to subscribe to a mailing list.
> - Consistent affordances and rendering of content, including Markdown support.  This is really useful for having technical discussions.
> - Better searching of topics, archiving, etc.
> - More tools for moderation.
> - Topic cross-referencing, and consistent organization of topics instead of whatever threading support a mail client provides (which is inconsistent).
>
> I also want to consider moving the -dev lists to the same forum setup as well; but that will be a separate conversation on those lists.
>
> A rollout plan has not been figured out.  People are busy and there are logistics to figure out.  I will be engaging a handful of members from the community to help with the transition.  Specifically, there are those who really value using email for participation on swift-evolution and swift-users, and the goal is to get the forum setup to allow those people to continue to feel effective when using email for discussions on these "lists".
>
> More details will be announced as they get figured out, but I felt it was important to let the community know about this direction.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; [unsigned math is evil](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/829044564220604417). ([gist](https://gist.github.com/steipete/06d101d41c93763f7d5e394dea3c56fe)) If only there were a language and compiler that could mitigate these kinds of issues... ðŸ˜‰
