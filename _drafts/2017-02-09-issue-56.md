### News and community

Chris Eidhof wrote a great post, [Classes That Conform To Protocols](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/classes-and-protocols/), that explains how to use type-erasers as a workaround until [generalized existentials](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#generalized-existentials) arrive in Swift.

Orta Therox wrote a [retrospective on using Swift at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/). It's an incredibly interesting post that actually ends up being more about the pros and cons of adopting [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) instead of converting to Swift. Most importantly, he highlights some major, systemic issues with Apple's developer tools and ecosystem &mdash; in particular the lack of openness (Radar) and lack of extensibility (Xcode).

The Swift Server APIs work group held their second security stream meeting, and [posted the meeting minutes](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/pull/72).

### Commits and pull requests

Dave Abrahams ([@dabrahams](https://github.com/dabrahams)) opened an initial [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6752) to rethink the existing Unicode implementation. This work is part of the [String Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/StringManifesto.md).

Erik Eckstein ([@eeckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein)) [made changes](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7274) to link a new re-mangler and de-mangler into the swift runtime library.

Slava Pestov ([@slavapestov](https://github.com/slavapestov)) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7296) an issue ([SR-3840](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3840)) where a closure that reads and writes to a computed parameter picks up the static type and not the dynamic type.

There's a [new repo](https://github.com/swift-server/security) under the [swift-server](https://github.com/swift-server) GitHub organization for the development of cross-platform Security APIs. It's currently empty except for a README, which has all of the details.
