### News and community

Chris Eidhof wrote a great post, [Classes That Conform To Protocols](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/classes-and-protocols/), that explains how to use type-erasers as a workaround until [generalized existentials](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#generalized-existentials) arrive in Swift.

### Commits and pull requests

Dave Abrahams ([@dabrahams](https://github.com/dabrahams)) opened an initial [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6752) to rethink the existing Unicode implementation. This work is part of the [String Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/StringManifesto.md).
