### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 10: [The Variety Show](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/68158)

This week we discuss multi-line strings, reduce with inout, one-sided ranges, and more!

### News and community

Sommer Panage discusses how to make writing UI code simpler with Swift in her talk, [Writing Your UI Swiftly](https://news.realm.io/news/sommer-panage-writing-your-ui-swiftly/) from [try! Swift Tokyo 2017](https://www.tryswift.co). The video was posted last month, but I've finally got around to watching it! It's really great, I highly recommend it.

Nate Cook also gave a great talk, [Swift's Pointy Bits: Unsafe Swift & Pointer Types](https://news.realm.io/news/nate-cook-tryswift-tokyo-unsafe-swift-and-pointer-types/), at [try! Swift Tokyo 2017](https://www.tryswift.co). Nate explores and explains what "safety" really means in Swift. Again, this video isn't extremely new, but I just watched it this week. Awesome talk.

### Commits and pull requests

Ben Cohen [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9374) `Collection` constraints via protocol where clauses requiring `Indices` and `SubSequence` match the traversal. This resolved 8 ABI FIXMEs!

Robin Kunde [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9070) diagnostic notes and fixits for confusable unicode characters.
