[SE-0218](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0218-introduce-compact-map-values.md): *Introduce `compactMapValues` to Dictionary* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0218-introduce-compactmapvalues-to-dictionary/14448).

> Feedback on the proposal was very positive â€“ the main concern being with the name, but this falls naturally out of our existing method names so is consistent, if clunky.
