### Accepted proposals

[SE-0218](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0218-introduce-compact-map-values.md): *Introduce `compactMapValues` to Dictionary* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0218-introduce-compactmapvalues-to-dictionary/14448).

> Feedback on the proposal was very positive â€“ the main concern being with the name, but this falls naturally out of our existing method names so is consistent, if clunky.

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0217](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0217-bangbang.md): *Introducing the `!!` "Unwrap or Die" operator to the Swift Standard Library* has been [rejected](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0217-the-unwrap-or-die-operator/14107/222).

> The core team has decided to reject this proposal as written. However, the core team concurs that the motivating problems posed by the proposal are important to solve, as did an overwhelming majority of commenters who participated in the public review. The fact that the only fixit the compiler offers to unwrap an Optional is to use the `!` operator is an unfortunate legacy of the Swift 1.0 days, before anything in the SDKs Swift was designed to work with had been audited for nullability, so force-unwrapping was far more of a necessity. Nowadays this legacy is actively harmful, and encourages bad habits in new Swift programmers, as the proposal and review discussion highlight extensively. It is clear too that `!` giving inadequate runtime feedback is a major problem, since a large contingent of the Swift community follows style guides that flat-out ban it, and the `guard ... else { fatalError("message") }` idiom is widespread as a way of more thoughtfully crashing on nil with an actionable error message.
