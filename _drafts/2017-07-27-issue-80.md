### Swift Unwrapped

This week in [Episode 21](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/77840), we dive into some of the recent proposals, including SE-0180, SE-0181, SE-0182, SE-0183.

### News and community

Not entirely related to Swift, but three new Darwin lib mirrors have appeared under the Apple GitHub organization over the past few weeks: [darwin-xnu](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu) (Darwin Kernel), [darwin-libplatform](https://github.com/apple/darwin-libplatform) (Darwin Platform Library), and [darwin-libpthread](https://github.com/apple/darwin-libpthread) (Darwin PThread Library). These were previously only available at [opensource.apple.com](https://opensource.apple.com).

### Proposals in review

The fourth revision of [SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md): *Protocol-oriented integers* is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-July/000394.html). You can find the [diff here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/f87bcb9b0f51dec13f6afc1c2f68e3a965edc4fe).

> Following feedback during the 4.0 preview, a handful of minor amendments have been suggested to SE-104: Protocol-oriented integers that the core team feels are important to include into 4.0 as they have an impact on source stability.
