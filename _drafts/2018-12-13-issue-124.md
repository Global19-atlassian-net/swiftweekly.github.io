### Accepted proposals

[SE-0236](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0236-package-manager-platform-deployment-settings.md): *Package Manager Platform Deployment Settings* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0236-package-manager-platform-deployment-settings/18420).

> There was a lot of negative feedback about the platform restrictions part of the proposal, so the SwiftPM code owners decided to accept a revised version of the proposal which only handles customization of deployment targets. The topic of platform restrictions for packages can be revisited separately at a later time.
>
> For specifying custom deployment versions, the original proposal mentions that an initializer will be provided. However, since that would be too verbose, a string overload will be provided instead. This makes the API `.macOS("10.13")` instead of `.macOS(MacOSVersion("10.13"))`.
