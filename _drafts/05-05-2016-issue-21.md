Welcome to issue #21! There hasn't been much news this week, so let's get on to the weekly brief.

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1395](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1395): [Compiler] Implement SE-0070: Make Optional Requirements Objective-C-only
- [SR-1393](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1393): [SwiftPM] Enforce Swift module import dependencies

These tasks are from previous issues that are still open and unassigned. Don't be shy and ask for help if you need it! 😊

- [SR-1340](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1340): [Compiler] Implement [SE-0068](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0068-universal-self.md), Expanding Swift `Self` to class members and value types. See the *Accepted proposals* section below for more details.
- [SR-1327](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1327): [Compiler] Using `dynamicType` on a force unwrapped `nil` value type doesn't throw an exception.
- [SR-1304](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1304): [SwiftPM] Handle spaces in path when parsing flags from pkgconfig
- [SR-1266](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1266): Remove duplication between `swift/test` and `swift/validation-test` configuration files. This is a good introduction to the Swift build system, its test suite, and CMake.
- [SR-1263](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1263): Compiler wrongfully complains of illegal syntax when declaring multiple conformances for a protocol's associated type.
- [SR-1174](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1174): [llbuild] Properly escape verbose command descriptions
- [SR-580](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-580): [Compiler] Warning should be produced for "variable was never mutated"

### Commits and pull requests

Bouke Haarsma opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/292) on SwiftPM to use `NSFileHandle` instead of `fopen`, as part of [SR-1005](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1005). 👍

Max Howell [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/296) `--update` in SwiftPM, to determine and apply updates.

Chris Willmore opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2322) with an initial implementation of [SE-0054](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0054-abolish-iuo.md): *Abolish `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` Type*. 👌

Brian Gesiak [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/86) added `XCTestRun` to corelibs-xctest. *"A major goal for swift-corelibs-xctest is API parity with Apple XCTest. This adds the largest missing API in swift-corelibs-xctest: `XCTestRun`."*

Brian Croom [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/102) class-level `setUp` and `tearDown` methods on `XCTestCase`.

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2364) that implements generating `XCTestCaseProvider` entries on Linux, [SR-710](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710). 😎

**@swiftix** [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2370) some Array-related performance regressions introduced by the new indexing model. 🙌

Daniel Duan [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2354) support for limiting `inout` capture to `@noescape` contexts, [SE-0035](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0035-limit-inout-capture.md).

### Accepted proposals

Stephen Canon's proposal, [SE-0067](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0067-floating-point-protocols.md): *Enhanced Floating Point Protocols*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000121.html) **for Swift 3**. 👏

> Overall, the feedback on the proposal was very positive, particularly for revision 2 of the proposal.
>
> The most significant feedback was around the naming issues for the various protocol requirements that map onto operators (e.g. “isLessThanOrEqualTo”).  The core team agrees that these are unfortunate - their naming is awkward and they will end up polluting code completion for instances of these numeric types. That said, we are accepting the proposal as written, because the rest of the proposal is great progress in the direction we want to go, accepting it will allow us to get experience living on it, and we can improve this issue with a follow-on proposal.
>
> To address the naming issues, we'd like to explore Tony Allevato's ideas in the “Improve operator requirements in protocols” thread on swift-evolution. If that doesn't work out, we request that these members be reworked to be named static members in the protocol, which will address the code completion issue.
>
> Thank you to Stephen Canon for driving the design and implementation of this, and to Max Moiseev (and several others) who have been contributing to the implementation.  This is a fundamental step to moving Swift numerics forward!

Doug Gregor's proposal, [SE-0071](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0071-member-keywords.md): *Allow (most) keywords in member references*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000122.html) **for Swift 3**. 🎉

> The discussion on swift-evolution was minimal, but entirely positive. This proposal eliminates a syntactic problem that would otherwise be new to Swift 3, with no apparent downside. What's not to love? Thank you to Doug Gregor for proposing this!

### Proposals in review

Jacob Bandes-Storch's proposal, [SE-0017](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0017-convert-unmanaged-to-use-unsafepointer.md): *Change Unmanaged to use UnsafePointer*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000117.html). Jacob proposes replacing the usage of `COpaquePointer` with `UnsafePointer<Void>` and `UnsafeMutablePointer<Void>` in the `Unmanaged` API to reduce bloated code where users must convert from `UnsafePointer` to `COpaquePointer` to `Unmanaged`.

Kevin Ballard's proposal, [SE-0032](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0032-sequencetype-find.md): *Add `find` method to `Sequence`*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000118.html). Kevin proposes to add a new extension method to `Sequence` called `find()` that returns the found element. *"It's often useful to find the first element of a sequence that passes some given predicate. [...] For Sequences, there's no easy way to do this besides a manual loop that doesn't require filtering the entire sequence and producing an array."*

Patrick Pijnappel's proposal, [SE-0052](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0052-iterator-post-nil-guarantee.md): *Change IteratorType post-nil guarantee*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000120.html).

> Currently, the documentation for `IteratorType.next()` has the precondition that when calling `next()`, no preceding call to `next()` should have returned `nil`, and in fact encourages implementations to raise a `preconditionFailure()` for violations of this requirement. However, all current 27 `IteratorType` implementations in the standard library return `nil` indefinitely. Many users are likely unaware of the precondition, expecting all iterators to return `nil` indefinitely and writing code that might rely on this assumption.

Kevin Ballard's proposal, [SE-0045](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0045-scan-takewhile-dropwhile.md): *Add `scan`, `prefix(while:)`, `drop(while:)`, and `unfold` to the stdlib*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000119.html). Kevin proposes adding 3 common (but currently missing from the stdlib) `Sequence` functions &mdash; `scan(_:combine:)`, `prefix(while:)`, and `drop(while:)`, with overrides as appropriate on `Collection`, `LazySequenceProtocol`, and `LazyCollectionProtocol`, as well as a global function `unfold(_:applying:)`.

And finally &mdash; the [error message of the day](https://twitter.com/FlexMonkey/status/727036117082583040)! Bummers. 🤔 😂
