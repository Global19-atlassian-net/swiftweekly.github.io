Welcome back to the weekly! I took a much need break last week, so I'll try to report on the last two weeks today. As always, if I missed anything, [send a pull request]({{ site.links.pull }})!

Xcode 8 beta 6 [was released](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_8_beta_6/Release_Notes_for_Xcode_8_beta_6.pdf) this week. It's a huge update from the previous beta, containing a number of completed swift-evolution proposals.

### Commits and pull requests

Paul Meng [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4102) changes to swift/sema to continue the work on [SE-0110](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0110-distingish-single-tuple-arg.md).

Daniel Dunbar [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/589) proposal [SE-0135](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0135-package-manager-support-for-differentiating-packages-by-swift-version.md). (See below)

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0135](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0135-package-manager-support-for-differentiating-packages-by-swift-version.md): *Package Manager Support for Differentiating Packages by Swift version* by Anders Bertelrud was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160801/000587.html).

> There was little feedback on the proposal, in particular relative to the complexity of the proposal and space of possible things we could do. We found this unfortunate, but are still accepting the proposal for the following reasons:
>
> 1. Since we cannot anticipate in advance how widely or for how long the Swift 3.0 package manager will be used, we feel it is important to have some escape hatch for Swift/SwiftPM version specific dependency selection.
> 2. The proposal is purely additive and intended to only be a short term mechanism. If it turns out to never be needed, or not suffice for the purpose for which it was designed, then we can remove it in a future release with little overhead.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0137](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0137-avoiding-lock-in.md): *Avoiding Lock-In to Legacy Protocol Designs* by Dave Abrahams and Dmitri Gribenko is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-August/000270.html).

> We propose to deprecate or move protocols that shouldn't be a part of the standard library's public API going forward.
>
> We've always known that when Swift reached ABI stability (now slated for Swift 4), we would be committed to supporting many of the standard library's design decisions for years to come.
>
> We only realized very recently that, although Swift 3.0 is not shipping with a stable ABI, the promise that Swift 3.0 code will work with Swift 4.0 means that many of the standard library's protocols will be locked down now. Especially where these protocols show up in refinement hierarchies, we won't be able to keep Swift 3 code working in the future without carrying them forward into future standard library binaries.
