### Starter tasks

- [SR-1165](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1165): Swift currently translates both `-[XCTest run]` and `-[XCTestRun runTest]` as `XCTest.run()`. Modify the apinotes for Apple XCTest such that Swift does not generate duplicate signatures for these two methods. This task will introduce you to Swift's "apinotes" feature, as well as with building the Swift project and running its test suite. Prerequisite: basic knowledge of Swift syntax.
