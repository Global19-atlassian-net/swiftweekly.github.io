So the lovely Greg took over last issue as I was at a conference, [try! Swift NYC](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/nyc/). I've had an amazing time at the conference (and New York) where I gave [a talk](https://speakerdeck.com/basthomas/taken-for-granted) about the history of Swift. A video of that talk will be posted in the future.

A big thank you goes out to the organizers, the volunteers and all of those who I got to meet at the conference!

That being said, and without further ado, here is an update on everything Swift from the past two weeks. A lot has happened!

### Commits and pull requests

The constraint solver is now iterative rather than recursive — this should fix some stack overflow issues: https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/19203

In Swift, foo.self always evaluates to foo. So naturally, .self should be a valid keypath as well: https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/19382
Now we’re just waiting for tuple keypaths so we can have full parity between member access syntax and keypath syntax

> A great number of questions are raised in these forums as to the functioning and design of numeric types and protocols in Swift. Sometimes, the answer can be found only by digging through the source code, and even then it's hard to place what you learn there within a larger context. Therefore, I've compiled a series of articles that delve into these topics in more detail.
