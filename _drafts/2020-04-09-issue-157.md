### News and community

[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) shared that Apple [is sponsoring
PLDI this year](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/1243235856791429122) â€” the
Programming Language Design and Implementation conference. As Ted said:

> Swift has drawn inspiration from many programming languages and those of us
working on Swift are proud to be part of the broader programming language
community.  

### Commits and pull requests

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0280](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses.md): *Enum cases as protocol witnesses* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses/34850).

> Almost all of the feedback we received was in favor of making this change,
and the Core Team is convinced that this closes an unnecessary semantic gap
between enums and other types.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0281](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0281-main-attribute.md): *`@main`: Type-Based Program Entry Points* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0281-main-type-based-program-entry-points/34948).

> A Swift language feature for designating a type as the entry point for
beginning program execution. Instead of writing top-level code, users can use
the `@main` attribute on a single type. Libraries and frameworks can then
provide custom entry-point behavior through protocols or class inheritance.
