The big news this week was that Swift 3.1 was officially released! Congratulations to the Core Team and open source contributors! This was a huge effort and aside from the notable features and proposals, there were dozens and dozens of fixes and improvements. Be sure to [report any bugs, regressions, or other issues](https://bugs.swift.org) that you run into.

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 4: [Bridging with Objective-C](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/61852)

This week we discuss bridging! There's been a constant push and pull on Objective-C bridging since Swift 1.x, trying to seek a balance but always swaying in the other direction.

### News and community

Swift 3.1 was [officially released](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-1-released/)!

> Swift 3.1 is a minor release that contains improvements and refinements to the Standard Library. Thanks to efforts by IBM and other members of the community, it also includes many updates to the Linux implementation of Swift. There are also a number of updates to Swift Package Manager.

Swift 3.1 includes the following proposals:

- [SE-0045: Add prefix(while:) and drop(while:) to stdlib](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0045-scan-takewhile-dropwhile.md)
- [SE-0141: Availability by Swift version](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0141-available-by-swift-version.md)
- [SE-0080: Failable Numeric Conversion Initializers](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0080-failable-numeric-initializers.md)
- [SE-0147: Move UnsafeMutablePointer.initialize(from:) to UnsafeMutableBufferPointer](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0147-move-unsafe-initialize-from.md)
- [SE-0082: Package Manager Editable Packages](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0082-swiftpm-package-edit.md)
- [SE-0145: Package Manager Version Pinning](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md)
- [SE-0152: Package Manager Tools Version](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0152-package-manager-tools-version.md)
- [SE-0151: Package Manager Swift Language Compatibility Version](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0151-package-manager-swift-language-compatibility-version.md)

Xcode 8.3 [was released](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03272017b) along with updates to all of Apple's platforms. Xcode 8.3 ships with Swift 3.1.

It looks like [JP Simard has already found an issue](https://twitter.com/simjp/status/846790346306576384) in Xcode 8.3. *"Xcode 8.3 produces binaries 3x larger than Xcode 8.2 due to a 4x increase in bitcode."* Oops. ðŸ˜³ ([rdar://31302382](http://www.openradar.me/31302382))

### Mailing lists

There's still been heavy debate on the lists over [SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md): *Fix Private Access Levels*. The core arguments that I covered [last week](/issue-62/) haven't changed so I'll avoid belaboring them. The review period was supposed to end on March 27, so we should see a decision from the Core Team soon.
