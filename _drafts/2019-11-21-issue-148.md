### Commits and pull requests

[Zoe Carver](https://github.com/zoecarver) is working on [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28260)
turning sequences of String comparisons into a fast switch.

[Brent Royal-Gordon](https://twitter.com/brentdax) is working on [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25656)
to make Swift `#file` strings include only the base name of the file, making
them a lot easier to digest.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0272](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0272-swiftpm-binary-dependencies.md): *Package Manager Binary Dependencies* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0272-package-manager-binary-dependencies/30753).

> SwiftPM currently supports source-only packages for several languages, and
with a very proscriptive build model which considerably limits exactly how the
compilation of the source can be performed. While this makes packages consistent
and to some extent "simple", it limits their use in several important cases:
* Software vendors who wish to provide easy integration with the package
  manager, but do not deliver source code, cannot integrate.
* Existing code bases which would like to integrate "simply" with SwiftPM, but
  require more complicated build processes, have no recourse.

[SE-0271](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0271-package-manager-resources.md): *Package Manager Resources* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0271-package-manager-resources/30730).

> Packages should be able to contain images, data files, and other resources
needed at runtime.  This proposal describes SwiftPM support for specifying such
package resources, and introduces a consistent way of accessing them from the
source code in the package.

[SE-0270](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0270-rangeset-and-collection-operations.md): *Add Collection Operations on Noncontiguous Elements* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0270-add-collection-operations-on-noncontiguous-elements/30691).

> We can use a `Range<Index>` to refer to a group of consecutive positions in a
collection, but the standard library doesn't currently provide a way to refer
to discontiguous positions in an arbitrary collection. I propose the addition
of a `RangeSet` type that can store any number of positions, along with
collection algorithms that operate on those positions.
