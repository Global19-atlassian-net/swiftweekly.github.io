Welcome back to the weekly! There was definitely some quiet time during the holidays in the US, but the repos are back to buzzing with activity.

<!--excerpt-->

### News and community

There's a new [swift-server](https://github.com/swift-server) organization on GitHub for the [Server APIs Project](https://swift.org/server-apis/). There's currently only one repository, [work-group](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group), that contains [meeting notes](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/tree/master/meetings) for the various sub-teams &mdash HTTP, networking, security.

Greg Heo wrote two great articles about two of the types in standard library: [*CollectionOfOne*](https://swiftunboxed.com/open-source/CollectionOfOne/) and [*IteratorOverOne*](https://swiftunboxed.com/open-source/IteratorOverOne/). Each post dives into the implementation details of the types, explaining each piece one by one. (See what I did there? ðŸ˜„)

### Commits and pull requests

Slava Pestov [completed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5935) some major refactoring work regarding function types in the AST. The `PolymorphicFunctionType` class was removed and subsumed by `GenericFunctionType`. This work, [the culmination of two years chipping away at technical debt in Swift generics](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/802942139873173504), resolved a 2013 FIXME. That code was so old, it could have been written on a newly updated Mac Pro. ðŸ˜‰

Alex Blewitt opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5903) to enable SourceKit building by default on Linux. More details are providing in [this email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20161121/003554.html) sent to swift-dev.

Hugh Bellamy [added support](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5904) for building Swift on Windows with [MSVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B). There are corresponding pull requests on [swift-clang](https://github.com/apple/swift-clang/pull/45) and [swift-llvm](https://github.com/apple/swift-llvm/pull/33). All 3 pull requests require merging in order for Swift to build successfully on Windows.

Chris Bailey has [posted the meeting minutes](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/pull/52) from the Swift Server Work Group HTTP kick-off meeting.

### Accepted proposals

Proposal [SE-0143](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0143-conditional-conformances.md): *Conditional conformances* by Doug Gregor [was accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-November/000295.html).

> The proposal has been accepted for Swift 4 phase 1. Reception was almost unanimously positive, and while there was valid discussion and concern about the limitations of the initial model as proposed and its impact on the future direction of Swift's generics model, the core team agrees that this is an independently useful and valuable expansion of the generics model that leaves the door open to future elaboration. Thank you Doug for writing and revising the proposal, and thank you to everyone who participated in its review!

Proposal [SE-0146](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0146-package-manager-product-definitions.md): *Package Manager Product Definitions* by Anders Bertelrud was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-November/000296.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-November/000298.html).

> The proposal received no feedback, but as the core team already agreed it is the right direction we will move forward with accepting and implementing it.

### Proposals in review

Proposal [SE-0145](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md): *Package Manager Version Pinning* was revised and is [under review again](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-November/000297.html).

> This is a proposal for adding package manager features to "pin" or "lock" package dependencies to particular versions.

### Mailing lists

[From Jordan Rose](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/Week-of-Mon-20161114/003982.html) on a thread about conditional conformance to protocols:

> Rule of thumb: overloads are resolved statically, protocol requirements are invoked dynamically. You cannot get dynamic behavior out of just overloads, ever.

### Finally

> TODO: something funny/fun. tweet, link, etc.
