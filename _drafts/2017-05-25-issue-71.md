Things have certainly been more quiet than usual as we approach [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc). Discussions on the [mailing lists](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170522/thread.html) (and even Twitter!) have been sparse. Only [two proposals](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) are awaiting or actively in review and it's unlikely we'll see any more proposals for Swift 4.

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 12: [Swift Evolution](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/69638)

We debate if Swift evolution is pulling its weight, and if it's possible for Swift to remain "open" without the cost.

### News and community

David Owens released and is continuing development on a Swift implementation of the Language Server Protocol spec. Find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/owensd/swift-lsp).
