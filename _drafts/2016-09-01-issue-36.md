It's almost that time of the year again when [Apple will reveal new iPhone models](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/). Invitations were sent to the press earlier this week for an event on September 7 &mdash; less than a week away! This likely means a final (or at least GM) release of Xcode 8 and the other platforms, and thus a final (or GM) release of Swift 3.

For me, this is least attractive aspect of Swift &mdash; being tied to the release cycles of Xcode, Apple's platforms, and hardware. Along with [radar](http://bugreport.apple.com), these deadlines (and thus the *real deadline* for Swift 3) present a closed door to the open source community. I think these things could eventually be detrimental to the health of the project, but let's see how the Swift 4 development cycle goes first! In any case, I think we're all excited and ready for Swift 3 to be finished! ðŸ˜„

### Starter tasks

- [SR-2451](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2451): [Compiler] Wording for labels in function types suggests that specific label cannot be used
- [SR-2442](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2442): [Compiler] Need better diagnostics for multi-value assignment with missing parentheses
- [SR-2409](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2409): [Compiler] Diagnostic refers to "Objective-C module" even on Linux

### Commits and pull requests

Doug Gregor [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4529) an amendment to [SE-0112](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md) that provides default implementations for all of the `CustomNSError` requirements.

Ankit Agarwal [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/625) documentation for the SwiftPM manifest file.
