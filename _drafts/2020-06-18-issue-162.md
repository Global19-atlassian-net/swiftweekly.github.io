    heading: Support the things you love
    body: Hello! My name is Paul and I run Hacking with Swift. I'm not going to use this spot to tell you to check out my books, but instead I'm sponsoring this issue because I appreciate the work that Bas and Kristaps do and I want to support them. Support the things you love, folks, otherwise they might just go away ❤️
