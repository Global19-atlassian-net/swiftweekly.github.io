This week Ted Kremenek wrote an official [blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-0-release-process/) on the Swift 3.0 release process. It's going to be an exciting release and it's still scheduled to ship later this year. Unfortunately, it won't be ready by WWDC 2016, but I'm sure we'll have a decent beta by then.

The main Swift [repository](https://github.com/apple/swift) also surpassed [30,000 stars](https://github.com/apple/swift/stargazers) this week! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Here's to an [amazing community](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/730613965995139072) &mdash; Swift certainly is [more than a programming language](https://speakerdeck.com/jessesquires/contributing-to-open-source-swift?slide=35). üòÑ

### Starter tasks

For recently accepted proposals (see below):

- [SR-1489](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1489): Implement support for [SE-0060](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0060-defaulted-parameter-order.md), enforcing order of defaulted parameters.
- [SR-1490](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1490): Implement [SE-0076](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0076-copying-to-unsafe-mutable-pointer-with-unsafe-pointer-source.md) by changing some `UnsafeMutablePointer` taking methods to take `UnsafePointer` instead.
- [SR-1491](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1491): Implement support for [SE-0080](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0080-failable-numeric-initializers.md), failable Numeric Conversion Initializers

From Danuel Duan:

- [SR-1469](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1469): Diagnostic for `init?` is reported at the end of the method despite an early return.

From Brian Gesiak:

- [SR-1421](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1421): Document the `sourcekitd-test` tool, which is used to quickly experiment with SourceKit. This task will involve writing a small amount of C++. You'll learn about LLVM's command line interface library and its argument parser, as well as about Swift's SourceKit.

### Accepted proposals

Joe Pamer's proposal, [SE-0072](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0072-eliminate-implicit-bridging-conversions.md): *Fully eliminate implicit bridging conversions from Swift*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000137.html) **for Swift 3**.

> The feedback on this proposal was positive - the benefits of simplifying the type system and eliminating surprising behavior from the compiler is universally appealing.  However, both the core team and the community wanted a better sense of what the impact of the proposal would be in practice on real code.  Joe Pamer did some analysis and found out that there isn't a significant impact on the most concerning [use case](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016644.html).

Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0066](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0066-standardize-function-type-syntax.md): *Standardize function type argument syntax to require parentheses*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000138.html) **for Swift 3**.

> There was a significant amount of feedback on the proposal, with a fairly common theme of ‚Äúlukewarm acceptance.‚Äù A number of community members were sad to see this familiar syntactic shortcut go away, but acknowledge that it fits well with recent directions, e.g., the elimination of the implicit tuple splat behavior [SE-0029](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0029-remove-implicit-tuple-splat.md). The core team acknowledges that the ability to elide parentheses is not actively harmful to the language, but felt that it was better to have consistency around function types (always have parentheses) than provide a relatively small syntactic shortcut for higher-order functions. The core team did not feel that this proposal needed to include required parentheses within closures, which have their own fairly specific grammar.

Joe Groff's proposal, [SE-0060](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0060-defaulted-parameter-order.md): *Enforcing order of defaulted parameters*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000146.html) **for Swift 3**.

> The feedback on the proposal was generally positive (several people remarked that they didn't know this was allowed). Some people pointed out that removal of this capability penalizes API design in cases where there is no inherent order to parameters, but this is also true of non-defaulted parameters. The core team prefers to encourage consistency at call sites.

Janosch Hildebrand's proposal, [SE-0076](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0076-copying-to-unsafe-mutable-pointer-with-unsafe-pointer-source.md): *Add overrides taking an `UnsafePointer` source to non-destructive copying methods on `UnsafeMutablePointer`*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000149.html) **with revisions for Swift 3**.

>The feedback on the proposal from the community and the core team universally agreed that there is a problem that needs to be solved here.  However, instead of adding overloads of the methods as proposed, it would be better to change the existing methods to take `UnsafePointer<>` instead of `UnsafeMutablePointer<>`. Given the existing promotion rules that exist in the compiler, it will achieve the same effect.  As part of this, other similar functions in the standard library should be audited and fixed as well.

Matthew Johnson's proposal, [SE-0080](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0080-failable-numeric-initializers.md): *Failable Numeric Conversion Initializers*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000150.html) **with revisions for Swift 3**.

> The feedback on the proposal from the community and the core team was universally positive, and the new initializers on the primitive integer and floating point types have been approved.  However, swift-evolution isn't the right mechanism to propose extensions to Foundation types, so the extensions that adds conversions from `NSNumber` and to Foundation types should be subset out of the proposal.

### Rejected proposals

Proposal [SE-0073](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0073-noescape-once.md): *Marking closures as executing exactly once* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000147.html) for Swift 3. Though feedback from the community and core team was positive, the proposal was reject for two main reasons. Chris Lattner notes that he would like to this discussed for a future release, beyond Swift 3.

> 1. The surface level syntax of `@noescape` needs to be reconsidered.  At the minimum, we need to rename `@noescape` to `@nonescaping` for consistency with our previously agreed attribute naming scheme.  However, it is also work discussing whether `@nonescaping` should be the default: if so, the attribute should actually become `@escaping`, and the functionality proposed in SE-0073 would be named `@once`.
>
> 2. Separate from the surface level issues, the implementation underlying this work has some significant challenges that are doable but would require major engineering work.  Specifically, the definite initialization pass needs to "codegen" booleans in some cases for conditional initialization/overwrite cases, and these state values would have to be added to closure capture lists.  This would require enough engineering work that it seems unlikely that it would happen in the Swift 3 timeframe [...]

Proposal [SE-0074](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0074-binary-search.md): *Implementation of Binary Search functions* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000148.html) for Swift 3. *"The feedback on the proposal was generally positive about the concept of adding binary search functionality, but negative about the proposal as written, with feedback that it was adding too much complexity to the API."*
