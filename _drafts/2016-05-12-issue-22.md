This week Ted Kremenek wrote an official [blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-0-release-process/) on the Swift 3.0 release process. It's going to be an exciting release and it's still scheduled to ship later this year. Unfortunately, it won't be ready by WWDC 2016, but I'm sure we'll have a decent beta by then. 😄

### Starter tasks

From Danuel Duan:

- [SR-1469](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1469): Diagnostic for `init?` is reported at the end of the method despite an early return.

From Brian Gesiak:

- [SR-1421](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1421): Document the `sourcekitd-test` tool, which is used to quickly experiment with SourceKit. This task will involve writing a small amount of C++. You'll learn about LLVM's command line interface library and its argument parser, as well as about Swift's SourceKit.

### Commits and pull requests

Bhargav Gurlanka [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/315) adding a JSON dumper for dependencies in SPM.

PJ Gray [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/352) adding support for ARMv6 on linux in corelibs-foundation.

Nate Cook [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2429) revisions to the documentation for core types and protocols.

Slava Pestov [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2452) closure reflection. (Note the pull request was closed, but the commits were merged manually.)

Michael Ilseman [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2434) CoreGraphics API naming changes for the latest API naming guidelines.

Joe Pamer [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2419) his proposal, [SE-0072](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0072-eliminate-implicit-bridging-conversions.md): *Fully eliminate implicit bridging conversions from Swift*. (Note: it was [reverted](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2440), then the revert was [reverted](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2441). [Yo dawg, I heard you like reverts](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/58010858.jpg). 😄)

Jordan Rose [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2420) changes to allow importing pointer-returning methods as throwing.

Jorge Bernal [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2423) proposal [SE-0070](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0070-optional-requirements.md): *Make Optional Requirements Objective-C-only*.

Congratulations to [Ankit Agarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r/status/729696879034798082) for becoming the [#2 contributor](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/graphs/contributors) on Swift package manager. 👏

### Accepted proposals

Joe Pamer's proposal, [SE-0072](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0072-eliminate-implicit-bridging-conversions.md): *Fully eliminate implicit bridging conversions from Swift*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000137.html) **for Swift 3**.

> The feedback on this proposal was positive - the benefits of simplifying the type system and eliminating surprising behavior from the compiler is universally appealing.  However, both the core team and the community wanted a better sense of what the impact of the proposal would be in practice on real code.  Joe Pamer did some analysis and found out that there isn't a significant impact on the most concerning [use case](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016644.html).

Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0066](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0066-standardize-function-type-syntax.md): *Standardize function type argument syntax to require parentheses*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000138.html) **for Swift 3**.

>There was a significant amount of feedback on the proposal, with a fairly common theme of “lukewarm acceptance.” A number of community members were sad to see this familiar syntactic shortcut go away, but acknowledge that it fits well with recent directions, e.g., the elimination of the implicit tuple splat behavior [SE-0029](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0029-remove-implicit-tuple-splat.md). The core team acknowledges that the ability to elide parentheses is not actively harmful to the language, but felt that it was better to have consistency around function types (always have parentheses) than provide a relatively small syntactic shortcut for higher-order functions. The core team did not feel that this proposal needed to include required parentheses within closures, which have their own fairly specific grammar.
