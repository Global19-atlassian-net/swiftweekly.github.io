### Starter tasks

From Brian Gesiak:

- [SR-1421](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1421): Document the `sourcekitd-test` tool, which is used to quickly experiment with SourceKit. This task will involve writing a small amount of C++. You'll learn about LLVM's command line interface library and its argument parser, as well as about Swift's SourceKit.
