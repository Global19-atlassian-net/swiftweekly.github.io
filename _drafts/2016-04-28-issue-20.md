Who was lucky enough to get a ticket to WWDC 2016? I'm excited to share that [I'll be attending](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/723708439487107073) this year. If you got a ticket too, I'll see you there! However, if you won't be at WWDC, don't worry. There are plenty of other great conferences &mdash; like Swift Summit, which has announced their [2016 conference](https://www.swiftsummit.com) in San Francisco. It will be held this year on November 7 and 8, and yours truly will be speaking. ðŸ¤“ Hope to see you there as well!
