Who was lucky enough to get a ticket to WWDC 2016? I'm excited to share that [I'll be attending](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/723708439487107073) this year. If you got a ticket too, I'll see you there! However, if you won't be at WWDC, don't worry. There are plenty of other great conferences &mdash; like Swift Summit, which has announced their [2016 conference](https://www.swiftsummit.com) in San Francisco. It will be held this year on November 7 and 8, and yours truly will be speaking. 🤓 Hope to see you there as well!

### Commits and pull requests

A few more issues have been added to the still-open [Swift 2.2.x milestone](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=✓&q=milestone%3A%22Swift+2.2.x%22+) on GitHub. My guess is that [Xcode 7.3.1](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.3.1/Xcode_7.3.1_GM_Seed_Release_Notes.pdf) will include these additional fixes.

Jordan Rose [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2255) a fix-it for non-optional bindings initialized with `nil`.

Joe Groff [enabled](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2304) the importing of Objective-C lightweight generic type parameters into Swift as generic classes.

**@codestergit** opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1527) to improve `MutableCollectionType.sort`, `MutableCollectionType.sortInPlace` and other sort related functions to take throwing closure.

Javier Soto merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2269) that adds tests for `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer` conformance to `Comparable`. 👏 ([SR-1238](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1238))
