This week on [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/61850) we discuss SourceKit and the tumultuous tales of the community getting SourceKit compiling on Linux. Ted Kremenek announced that `swift-stdlib-tool` will *remain* in Xcode, and it was a quiet week for proposals.

### Swift Unwrapped

In this week's episode &mdash; [SourceKit (Compiling by default)](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/61850) &mdash; we dive into the framework we love to hate to love: SourceKit. We wrap up with an overview of method dispatch in Swift. As always, let us know what you think. If you have a second, [rate us on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/swift-unwrapped/id1209817203).

### News and community

Ayaka Nonaka's ([@ayanonagon](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon)) talk from Swift Summit, [*Contributing to the Swift compiler*](https://www.skilled.io/u/swiftsummit/contributing-to-the-swift-compiler), is now available. This talk is absolutely great. It was one of my favorites from Swift Summit. If you are interested in contributing, but not sure where to start, this is a must-watch video! You can find the [slides here](https://speakerdeck.com/ayanonagon/contributing-to-swift).

[Last week](/issue-60/) the community was concerned about the removal of `swift-stdlib-tool`. Brian Gesiak ([@modocache](https://twitter.com/modocache)) wrote a post, [*Why do I care about swift-stdlib-tool?*](http://modocache.io/swift-stdlib-tool), to explain why this is command line tool is so important for the community. After what I can only imagine were **a lot** of radars, Ted Kremenek [confirmed](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/841179077130170368) that Xcode 8.3 will ship with `swift-stdlib-tool`. ðŸŽ‰

John Regehr wrote an awesome article, [*A Touristâ€™s Guide to the LLVM Source Code*](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1453). This isn't new (written in January 2017) but I'm sure it's recent enough to still be relevant. Thanks to [Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/841014140290363392) for sharing this week. If your interest in Swift runs deeper than Swift itself and you want to get involved in [LLVM](http://llvm.org), this looks like a fantastic resource.

### Commits and pull requests

Robert Widmann ([@CodaFi](https://github.com/CodaFi)) [resolved](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8059) 22 compiler crashers and then followed that up by [fixing](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8066) 24 more! ðŸ˜± Slava (known for smashing tons of bugs) better watch out! ðŸ˜†

Slava Pestov ([@slavapestov](https://github.com/slavapestov)) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8091) a [crash](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3541) when calling a method on a generic base class with a concrete subclass, which has been broken since [at least Swift 2](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/841814023507136512).

Erik Eckstein ([@eeckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein)) [merged changes](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8018) to IRGen to emit type metadata and (value) witness tables lazily, which could result in binary size reductions up to 20 percent! ðŸ™Œ

> This gives big code size wins for unused types and also for types, which are never used in a generic context. Also it reduces the amount of symbols in the symbol table. The size wins heavily depend on the project. I have seen binary size reductions from 0 to 20% on real world projects.

The [Swift server work group](https://github.com/swift-server) held their second HTTP stream meeting. Chris Bailey ([@seabaylea](https://github.com/seabaylea)) has [posted](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/pull/74) the initial meeting notes, though they are currently empty.
