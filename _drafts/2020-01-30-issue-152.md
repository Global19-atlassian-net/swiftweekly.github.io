### News and community

[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) shared [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/on-the-road-to-swift-6/32862)
on the road to Swift 6, with many interesting insights. If there's one thing
you're going to pick up from this issue, it should be this — it's a great read.
Some things mentioned:

- Faster builds
- More informative and accurate diagnostics
- Reliable and fluid debugging experience
- Provide excellent solutions for major language features such as memory
ownership and concurrency
- Significantly improve the performance of incremental builds
- Improve code completion performance, reliability, and experience

Like I said; you're going to want to give this a read.

[JP Simard](https://twitter.com/simjp) created a poll [about the oldest Swift version people are actively using](https://twitter.com/simjp/status/1218613429881040897);
a quite surprisingly high amount (to me) is pretty up-to-date with the latest
Swift versions!

[George Barnett](https://twitter.com/glbrntt) released [SwiftNIO 2.13.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/releases/tag/2.13.0).

### Commits and pull requests

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://twitter.com/pyaskevich) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28837)
that is a big step toward improving type inference for closures over time.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0270](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0270-rangeset-and-collection-operations.md): *Add Collection Operations on Noncontiguous Elements* is [under a third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0270-review-3-add-collection-operations-on-noncontiguous-elements/32839).

> We can use a `Range<Index>` to refer to a group of consecutive positions in a
collection, but the standard library doesn't currently provide a way to refer
to discontiguous positions in an arbitrary collection. I propose the addition
of a `RangeSet` type that can represent any number of positions, along with
collection algorithms that operate on those positions.
>
> There are varied uses for tracking multiple elements in a collection, such as
maintaining the selection in a list of items, or refining a filter or search
result set after getting more input from a user.
>
> The Foundation data type most suited for this purpose, `IndexSet`, uses
integers only, which limits its usefulness to arrays and other random-access
collection types. The standard library is missing a collection that can
efficiently store ranges of indices, and is missing the operations that you
might want to perform with such a collection. These operations themselves can
be challenging to implement correctly, and have performance traps as well — see
last year's [Embracing Algorithms](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2018/?id=223)
WWDC talk for a demonstration.

### Swift Forums

[Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://twitter.com/jumhyn) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/allow-chained-member-references-in-implicit-member-expressions/32829)
to allow chained member references in implicit member expressions.

> I propose that we extend implicit member syntax (a.k.a. "leading dot syntax")
to allow for chained member references rather than just a single level.
>
> When the type of an expression is implied by the context, Swift allows
developers to use what is formally referred to as an "implicit member
expression", sometimes referred to as "leading dot syntax":

```swift
class C {
    static let zero = C(0)
    var x: Int

    init(_ x: Int) {
        self.x = x
    }
}

func f(_ c: C) {
    print(c.x)
}

f(.zero) // prints '0'
```

> However, attempting to use this with a chain of member references fails:

```swift
extension C {
    var incremented: C {
        return C(self.x + 1)
    }
}

f(.zero.incremented) // Error: Type of expression is ambiguous without more context
```

> On master, the new diagnostic system has improved the produced error:

```swift
f(.zero.incremented) // Error: Cannot infer contextual base in reference to member 'zero'
```

> but the same problem persists.
