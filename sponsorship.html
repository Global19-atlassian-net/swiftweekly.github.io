      <p>Swift Weekly Brief is distributed every Thursday to thousands of savvy Swift developers and enthusiasts.
      Each issue contains quality links and commentary on what's happening in the Swift.org open source projects,
      as well as what's happening in the Swift community at large.</p>
      <h3>Sponsored Links</h3>
      <p>There is a single Sponsored Link available per issue for $75. This is featured prominently at the beginning of an issue,
